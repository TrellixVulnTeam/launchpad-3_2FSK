Entitlements are a means of recording features and privileges
Launchpad users have been assigned.  The business model for these
assignments is not important, but it could be through a commercial
arrangement or through a grant that applies to everyone.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates

Be a superuser:

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

Find a team with an entitlement.

    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> print ubuntu_team.name
    ubuntu-team

    >>> entitlements = ubuntu_team.entitlements
    >>> entitlements.count() == 2
    True

    >>> entitlement = entitlements[0]
    >>> entitlement.quota = 100
    >>> entitlement.amount_used = 0
    >>> entitlement.exceededQuota
    False
