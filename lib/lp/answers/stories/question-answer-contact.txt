= Answer Contacts =

Each product and distros can have answer contacts. Answer contacts
receive notifications for new questions as well as changes to existing
ones.

The list of answer contacts is displayed in the 'Answer Contact'
portlet which is available on the 'Answers' facet of the product or
distribution.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.addHeader('Accept-Language', 'en, es')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions')
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-answer-contacts'))
    Answer contacts for Ubuntu
    There are no answer contacts.

Anybody can become an answer contact. To register as an answer contact,
the user clicks on the 'Set answer Contact' link:

    >>> browser.getLink('Set answer contact').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Answer contact for Ubuntu Linux

    >>> description = find_main_content(browser.contents).p
    >>> print extract_text(description)
    An answer contact...will receive changes related to all questions
    (written in one of your preferred languages)...

That page displays a series of checkboxes. One for the user and one for
each team that user is an administrator of.

    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.answer_contact_teams').options
    ['landscape-developers', 'launchpad-users']

The user can select any of these checkboxes to register as an answer
contact himself or one of the team for which he's an administrator. In
our case, the user decides to register himself and the Landscape
Developers team.

    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     "I want to be an answer contact for Ubuntu").selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl("Landscape Developers").selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

Confirmation of the answer contact registrations are displayed and the
new answer contacts appear in the 'Answer Contacts' portlet. In this
example Sample Person sees two additional notifications about preferred
languages (more on this below).

    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Your preferred languages were updated to include your browser languages: 
    English (en), Spanish (es).
    You have been added as an answer contact for Ubuntu.
    English was added to Landscape Developers's preferred languages.
    Landscape Developers has been added as an answer contact for Ubuntu.

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...    find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-answer-contacts'))

    Sample Person

Answer contacts must tell Launchpad which languages they provide
help in. As a convenience, the Answer Tracker will set the Person's
preferred languages for him. The browser languages are used for a
Person. In the case of a Team, only English is added. Sample Person
reads the notice that his preferred languages were set, and uses the
link to in the notice to review the changes. Sample Person's browser
sends the accept-languages header with English and Spanish.

    >>> browser.getLink('Your preferred languages').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Sample Person's preferred languages

    >>> browser.getControl('English', index=0).selected
    True
    >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected
    True

To remove oneself from the answer contacts, the user uses the same
'Set answer contact' link and uncheck himself or the team he want to remove
from the answer contact list.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions')
    >>> browser.getLink('Set answer contact').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     "I want to be an answer contact for Ubuntu").selected
    True
    >>> browser.getControl("Landscape Developers").selected
    True
    >>> browser.getControl("Landscape Developers").selected = False
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

A confirmation message is displayed:

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    Landscape Developers has been removed as an answer contact for Ubuntu.

Since answer contacts are notified of changes to questions, they are also
listed in the 'Also notified' list in the 'Subscribers' portlet on a
question.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/7')
    >>> portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-subscribers')
    >>> also_notified = portlet.find('b')
    >>> also_notified
    <b>Also notified:</b>
    >>> print extract_text(also_notified.findNextSibling('ul'))
    Sample Person


== Product Answer Contacts ==

The 'Set answer contact' action is also available on products:

    >>> browser.open('http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> browser.getLink('Set answer contact').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Answer contact for Mozilla Firefox
    >>> print browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+answer-contact


== Answer Contact teams and preferred languages ==

Answer contacts support questions written in their preferred languages.
Team, may have preferred languages, but do not normally configure them.
So teams are given English language by default when a team becomes an
answer contact. Team admins may configure a team's preferred languages
to set exactly which languages the team supports.


Sample Person visits the Answers facet of Ubuntu as described in
the  main story above. He wants Landscape Developers team to be
answer contacts for Ubuntu, but only for Spanish questions to keep
the email traffic to a manageable volume.

    >>> browser.open('http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/')
    >>> browser.title
    'Questions for Ubuntu'

    >>> browser.getLink('Set answer contact').click()
    >>> browser.getControl("Landscape Developers").selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Landscape Developers has been added as an answer contact for Ubuntu.

Sample Person navigates to the team page to set it's preferred
languages. He must add Spanish to the team's preferred languages.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~landscape-developers')
    >>> browser.title
    'Landscape Developers in Launchpad'

    >>> browser.getLink('Set preferred languages').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Landscape Developers's preferred languages

Sample Person may be surprised to see English is already selected.
Per the notification issued in the first example above, English was
added to the team's preferred languages. We did not see the
notification this time since the languages are set. Sample Person
unselects English, and selects Spanish.

    >>> browser.getControl('English', index=0).selected
    True

    >>> browser.getControl('English', index=0).selected = False
    >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()

Sample Person then checks a few questions to see that the Landscape
Developers Team is not subscribed to English questions, and is
subscribed to Spanish questions.

    >>> browser.open('http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/')
    >>> browser.title
    'Questions for Ubuntu'

    >>> browser.getLink('Play DVDs in Totem').click()
    >>> print extract_text(browser.title)
    Ubuntu question #10:...Play DVDs in Totem...

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Ubuntu question #10')
    >>> language = portlet.find('b', text='Language:')
    >>> print language, language.next.strip()
    Language: English

    >>> portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-subscribers')
    >>> print extract_text(portlet)
    Subscribers
    Sample Person
    Also notified:
    Sample Person

The English question is correct, so Sample Person locates a Spanish
Question:

    >>> browser.open('http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/12')
    >>> browser.title
    'Ubuntu question #12:...Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp...'

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Ubuntu question #12')
    >>> language = portlet.find('b', text='Language:')
    >>> print language, language.next.strip()
    Language: Spanish

    >>> portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-subscribers')
    >>> print extract_text(portlet).encode('ASCII', 'backslashreplace')
