  Change the owner of the mozilla project.


  Logged in as no-priv@canonical.com we can't do that, because he's not the
  owner of the project nor a member of admins.

  >>> print http(r"""

  Now we're logged in as mark@hbd.com and he's the owner of the admins team,
  so he can do everything.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /mozilla/+reassign HTTP/1.1

  Here he changes the owner to himself.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /mozilla/+reassign HTTP/1.1
