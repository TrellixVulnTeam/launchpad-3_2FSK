          Incomplete bug reports can expire if they are unattended and they
          become inactive. These bugs are not confirmed, or in a status
          that indicates they were confirmed. An Incomplete bug can remain
          in this list indefinitely, so long as the bug is regularly updated.

        Projects may choose to enable expiration of unattended Incomplete bug
        reports when they become inactive. Bugs are considered unattended if
        they are not assigned to a person or a milestone. Bug reports's are
        considered inactive when the bug has not been updated in
        <tal:expiration_age replace="view/inactive_expiration_age" /> days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bugs are listed from oldest to newest--bugs at the top of the
        list will expire sooner. A bug report will be removed from this list
        when it's status moved from Incomplete, or because it is assigned to
        a person or milestone.
