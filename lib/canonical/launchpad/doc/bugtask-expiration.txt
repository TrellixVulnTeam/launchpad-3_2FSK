= Bugtask Expiration =

Old unassigned INCOMPLETE bugtasks clutter Malone's search results,
making the bug staff's job difficult. A script is run daily to
locate unassigned INCOMPLETE bugtasks that have not been updated in
2 months, and sets their status to INVALID. Only bugtasks for projects
that use Malone will be expired; this rule does not apply to Bugs
imported from upstream bug trackers. The four preconditions are:

1. The bugtask belongs to a project that uses Malone to track bugs.
2. The last message on the Bug is older than 60 days.
3. The bugtask has the status INCOMPLETE.
4. The bugtask is not assigned to anyone.

Bugtasks cannot transition to INVALID automatically unless they meet
all the rules stated above.

== Setup ==

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import BugTask
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     BugTaskStatus, IDistributionSet, IBugTaskSet, ILaunchBag)

    # Sample Person is a bug contact for Ubuntu and may update the BugTasks.
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> bugtaskset = getUtility(IBugTaskSet)

There are no INVALID Bugtasks in sampledata.

    >>> BugTask.selectBy(status=BugTaskStatus.INVALID).count()
    0


== Age ==

The expiration period is set using the
config.alone.days_before_expiration configuration variable. It
defaults to 60 days. The period is measured from the date_incomplete
field. We expire bugtasks that are INCOMPLETE for 60 days or more.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> old_age_days = config.malone.days_before_expiration
    >>> old_age_days
    60


== findExpirableBugTasks ==

BugTaskSet provides findExpirableBugTasks to find bugtasks that
qualify for expiration. The bugtasks must have the status of
Incomplete, be unassigned, and affecting a distribution or
product that uses Malone.

findExpirableBugTasks requires a parameter for the minimum days old
(min_days_old) that the bugtask has been in the Incomplete status
without message activity.
ubuntu_edgy_milestone = ubuntu.currentseries.newMilestone("knot1")

    >>> expirable_bugtasks = bugtaskset.findExpirableBugTasks()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: findExpirableBugTasks() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

There are no expirable bugtasks in the sampledata.

    >>> expirable_bugtasks = bugtaskset.findExpirableBugTasks(9999)
    >>> len(expirable_bugtasks)
    0

Let's make some bugtasks that qualify for expiration. A Jokosher
bugtask and a conjoined pair of ubuntu_hoary and ubuntu bugtasks
will suffice.

    # A expirable bugtask. It will be expired because its conjoined
    # master can be expired.
    >>> ubuntu_bugtask = create_old_bug(
    ...     'expirable_distro', 351, ubuntu)

    # An expirable bugtask, a distroseries.
    >>> hoary_bugtask = bugtaskset.createTask(
    ...     bug=ubuntu_bugtask.bug, owner=sample_person,
    ...     distroseries=ubuntu.currentseries)

    # A bugtask for a product that is expirable.
    >>> jokosher_bugtask = create_old_bug(
    ...     'jokosher', 61, jokosher)

Lets also make some bugs that almost qualify for expiration.

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it is assigned.
    >>> assigned_bugtask = create_old_bug('assigned', 61, ubuntu)
    >>> assigned_bugtask.transitionToAssignee(sample_person)

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because its status is CONFIRMED.
    >>> confirmed_bugtask = create_old_bug(
    ...     'confirmed', 61, ubuntu, status=BugTaskStatus.CONFIRMED)

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it is a duplicate.
    >>> duplicate_bugtask = create_old_bug('duplicate', 61, ubuntu)
    >>> duplicate_bugtask.bug.duplicateof = confirmed_bugtask.bug

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it does not use Malone.
    >>> external_bugtask = create_old_bug('external', 61, thunderbird)

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it has a milestone.
    >>> milestone_bugtask = create_old_bug('milestone', 61, ubuntu)
    >>> milestone_bugtask.milestone = ubuntu.currentseries.newMilestone("0.1")

    # An new bugtask that is not expirable, on a bug with many bugtasks.
    >>> new_bugtask = bugtaskset.createTask(
    ...     bug=ubuntu_bugtask.bug, owner=sample_person,
    ...     product=thunderbird)

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it has no messages.
    >>> no_replys_bugtask = create_old_bug(
    ...     'no_replys', 61, ubuntu, with_message=False)

    # A bugtask that is not expirable because it not old.
    >>> recent_bugtask = create_old_bug('recent', 31, ubuntu)

    >>> bugtasks = [ubuntu_bugtask, hoary_bugtask,
    ...     new_bugtask, jokosher_bugtask, assigned_bugtask,
    ...     confirmed_bugtask, duplicate_bugtask, external_bugtask,
    ...     milestone_bugtask, no_replys_bugtask, recent_bugtask]

    >>> summarize_bugtask(bugtasks)

    # Flush the caches so that the bugtasks defined above get
    # their content from the modified DB.
    >>> flush_database_caches()

The value of the min_days_old controls the bugtasks that are returned.

    # No bugtask is older than 352 days.
    >>> expirable_bugtasks = bugtaskset.findExpirableBugTasks(352)
    >>> len(expirable_bugtasks)
    0

The ubuntu_hoary_bugtask does not display because its bug has other
bugtasks that are valid.

    # There are bugs older than 350 days, yet none are expirable.
    >>> expirable_bugtasks = bugtaskset.findExpirableBugTasks(350)
    >>> len(expirable_bugtasks)
    0

    >>> for bt in hoary_bugtask.bug.bugtasks:

    Mozilla Thunderbird   New
    Ubuntu                Incomplete
    Ubuntu Hoary          Incomplete

If the valid bugtask becomes Invalid or Won't Fix, the Hoary bugtask
will be displayed The ubuntu_bugtask is never returned; it is a
conjoined slave to the ubuntu_hoary_bugtask. Slave bugtasks cannot be
directly expired because only the master bugtask can change the status.

    >>> new_bugtask.transitionToStatus(
    ...     BugTaskStatus.WONTFIX, sample_person)

    >>> for bt in hoary_bugtask.bug.bugtasks:

    hoary        True    351  Incomplete  False     False  False  False

Reducing the age to 60 days old, both hoary and jokosher bugtasks
are returned.

    >>> expirable_bugtasks = bugtaskset.findExpirableBugTasks(60)
    >>> summarize_bugtask(expirable_bugtasks)

== Running the script ==

The script 'expire-bugs.py' writes its report to stdout. It makes its
database changes as the Bug Watch Updater user.

    >>> starting_bug_messages_count = (
    ...     hoary_bugtask.bug.messages.count())

    # Commit the current transaction because the script will run in
    # another transaction, and thus it won't see the changes done on
    # this test unless we commit.
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> commit()

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     'cronscripts/expire-bugtasks.py', shell=True,
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> print err
    INFO    creating lockfile

    # their content from the modified DB.
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_caches
    >>> flush_database_caches()


== After the script has run ==

There are four Invalid bugtasks. Thundirbird was expired previously in
the test. Jokosher, hoary and ubuntu were expired by the expiration
process. Although ubuntu was never returned by findExpirableBugTasks,
it was expired because its master (hoary) was expired.

    >>> summarize_bugtask(bugtasks)
    ROLE         MALONE  AGE  STATUS      ASSIGNED  DUP    MILE   REPLY?
    ubuntu       True      0  Invalid     False     False  False  False
    hoary        True      0  Invalid     False     False  False  False
    thunderbird  False     0  Won't Fix   False     False  False  False
    jokosher     True      0  Invalid     False     False  False  False
    assigned     True     61  Incomplete  True      False  False  False
    confirmed    True     61  Confirmed   False     False  False  False
    duplicate    True     61  Incomplete  False     True   False  False
    external     False    61  Incomplete  False     False  False  False
    milestone    True     61  Incomplete  False     False  True   False
    no_replys    True     61  Incomplete  False     False  False  True
    recent       True     31  Incomplete  False     False  False  False

The remaining Incomplete bugtasks are unchanged.

    >>> invalid_bugtasks = BugTask.selectBy(status=BugTaskStatus.INVALID)
    >>> invalid_bugtasks.count()
    3
    >>> for bugtask in invalid_bugtasks:
    ...     print bugtask.bugtargetdisplayname
    Ubuntu
    Jokosher
    Ubuntu Hoary

The bugtasks statusexplaination was updated to explain the change in
status.

    >>> print hoary_bugtask.statusexplanation
    [Expired for Ubuntu Hoary because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

The message explaining the reason for the expiration was posted by the
Bug Janitor celebrity. Only one message was created for when the master
and slave bugtasks were expired.

    >>> ending_bug_messages_count = (
    ...     hoary_bugtask.bug.messages.count())
    >>> ending_bug_messages_count
    3
    >>> starting_bug_messages_count + 1 == ending_bug_messages_count
    True

    >>> message =  hoary_bugtask.bug.messages[-1]
    >>> print message.owner.name
    janitor

    >>> print message.text_contents
    [Expired for Ubuntu Hoary because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

The bug's activity log was updated too.
