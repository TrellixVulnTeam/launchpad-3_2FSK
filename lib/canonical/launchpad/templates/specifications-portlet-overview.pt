  <h4>The specification tracker:</h4>

  <div class="portletBody portletContent">

    Each specification describes a new feature. You can coordinate
    "sprints", which are meetings at which specs will be defined and
    implemented. See the <a href="/sprints/">sprint tracker</a> for the full
    list of sprints.
