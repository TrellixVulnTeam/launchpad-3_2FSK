The bugtask search facility supports searching on a simple text
string.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /firefox/+bugs?field.searchtext=install&search=Search&advanced=&milestone=1&status=10&status=20&assignee=all HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Referer: http://localhost:9000/bugs/products/firefox/+bugs
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...2 results...
  ...Firefox install instructions should be complete...
  ...Firefox does not support SVG...


  If we search for something and get no matches, it'll say so in a meaningful
  way instead of displaying an empty table.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /firefox/+bugs?field.searchtext=fdsafsf&search=Search&advanced=&milestone=1&status=10&status=20&assignee=all HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...No results for search...
  ...


  Similarly, if we don't do a search and there are no open bugs on that product,
  it'll say so.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /iso-codes/+bugs HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...There are currently no open bugs...
  ...
