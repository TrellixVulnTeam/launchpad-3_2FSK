    <h1>Welcome to The Launchpad!</h1>

    <p>The Launchpad is a collection of services for projects in the open
    source universe. Here you can register your project, and collaborate
    with your community on translations, bug squashing and the code you
    write.</p>

    <h2><a title="Rosetta" href="rosetta">Rosetta</a></h2>

    <p>Rosetta is a <b>web-based translation portal</b>. If your application
    uses the open source standard <i>gettext</i> system for software
    internationalisation, then you can easily have users contribute
    translations for your software through Rosetta. You simply upload the
    existing translations, point your community at Rosetta and then download
    their translations before you make your release.
    <a title="Rosetta" href="rosetta">Translate now!</a></p>

    <h2><a title="Malone" href="malone">Malone</a></h2>

    <p>Malone is a <b>web-based global bug tracking</b> tool. It is designed
    to track bugs across the whole open source process: it understands that
    the same code is re-used upstream and in different distributions, and
    allows us to have a single bug number for any bug, and track where it
    has been fixed and where it is still a problem.
    <a title="Malone" href="malone">Track bugs now!</a></p>

    <h2><a title="DOAP Registry" href="doap">DOAP Registry</a></h2>

    <p>A key part of the Launchpad is its <b>registry of open source and
    related projects</b>. This registry, inspired by the DOAP framework,
    allows us to keep track of all the open source software which uses the
    Launchpad for translations, bug management and distributed code
    management. You can register individual open source applications, or
    whole projects, and track the relationships between them.
