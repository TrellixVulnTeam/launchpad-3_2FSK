Ticket Comments
===============

We will examine Ticket #3, on Ubuntu. When not logged in, we should not be
able to make a comment.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...To post a comment you must...

When logged in, we should see the ability to add a comment. The default
subject should be based on the title, since there are no existing comments.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Add comment...
  ...<input name="field.subject" type="text" size="50"...value="Re: Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM" />...

If we POST that form, we should be redirected back to the ticket page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3/+addmessage HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 89
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  ... field.subject=Use+a+new+computer&field.content=You+silly+fart.&UPDATE_SUBMIT=Post+Comment""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://.../distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3
  ...

And we should see the comment.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Use a new computer...
  ...You silly fart...

Now we will examine Ticket #2 on Firefox. It should currently be Open. We
should have the ability to make a comment. And we should be able to say that
the ticket is "answered".

If we POST that form, checking the "answers" box, we should set the status
to "Answered" and we should get a date answered too.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+addmessage HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 112

  ... 
  ... field.subject=Use+a+new+computer&field.content=You+silly+fart.&field.resolved=answers&UPDATE_SUBMIT=Post+Comment""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://.../products/firefox/+ticket/2

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Answered...
  ...Answered by:...
  ...Foo Bar...
  ...Answered:...


Finally, we will respond with a message from the person who created this
ticket, also saying it is answered. That should set the status to Closed.
