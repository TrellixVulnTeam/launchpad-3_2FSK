  While seeing a bug in a context that it wasn't reported, we're given a easy
  way to report it by clicking in the Also Needs Fixing Here button.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /ubuntu/+source/mozilla-firefox/+bug/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... reportbug=Also+Needs+Fixing+Here""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Thank you for your bug report...
  ...

  If we try to report it again, we should get a nice error message.

  >>> print http(r"""

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok

  ...The bug is already reported in this context...
