    <h1>Uploading an updated .po file</h1>

    <p>
      When you download a .po file from Launchpad, update it, and then
      upload your edited .po file back to Launchpad, it will be treated
      the same as if the translations had been made using Launchpad's web
      interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Structuring the .po file</h2>

    <p>
      Launchpad will only accept the .po file if it has the
      <code>X-Exported-From-Launchpad</code> header. That header is
      automatically added when you export a .po file from Launchpad.
    </p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to ensure Launchpad accepts your .po file as an
      update is to export a .po file from Launchpad, edit only the
      strings and then upload it back to Launchpad.
