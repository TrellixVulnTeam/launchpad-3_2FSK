# Put your TODOs for this branch here, then make sure it is empty before
# landing. There is a test to ensure it is empty in trunk. If there is
# stuff still here when you are ready to land, the items should probably
# be converted to bugs so they can be scheduled.

 * Deal with bad URLs correctly (currently, regex allows
   /tracker2index.php, which is, of course, patent bollocks.
