When displaying the comments on the main bug page they are truncated if
they are too long. In order to show that, let's set the limit to a
small value.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> OLD_COMMENT_SIZE = config.malone.max_comment_size
    >>> config.malone.max_comment_size = '45'

Bug number two starts with a short comment followed by two longer ones,
the first one will be displayed as it is, and the other two will be
truncated.

    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/bugs/2')
    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.contents)
    >>> comment_divs = soup('div', 'boardCommentBody')
    >>> for div_tag in comment_divs:
    ...     print div_tag #doctest: -ELLIPSIS
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <p>Problem exists between chair and keyboard</p>
    </div>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <p>This would be a real killer feature. If there...</p>
    </div>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <p>Oddly enough the bug system seems only capabl...</p>
    </div>

    >>> config.malone.max_comment_size = OLD_COMMENT_SIZE
