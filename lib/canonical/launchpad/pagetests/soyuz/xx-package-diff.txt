== Package Diff ==

'Available diffs' page section is only presented when there is, at
least, one `PackageDiff` recorded in the database for a context
SourcePackageRelease.

It's exposed in the following pages:

 * Ubuntu sources (`DistributionSourcePackage`);
 * Ubuntu source release (`DistributionSourcePackageRelease`);
 * PPA sources (PPA Overview).

The section is rendered based on the `SourcePackageRelease` content
class, so, theoretically is can be displayed in any page that has
access to one or more objects of this nature.

When there is no diff available the 'Available diffs' section is
omitted.

The pages mentioned are public, therefore the package diffs are also
public.

See further information about `PackageDiff` documentation in
doc/package-diff.txt.


== Testable diff setup ==

We will create a set of `PackageDiff` so we can precisely test how
they show up in the UI.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IPersonSet)

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> hoary = ubuntu.getSeries('hoary')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.test_publishing import (
    ...     SoyuzTestPublisher)
    >>> test_publisher = SoyuzTestPublisher()
    >>> name16 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> test_publisher.person = name16

Create a series of 'biscuit' sources in ubuntu primary archive.

    >>> biscuit_one_pub = test_publisher.getPubSource(
    ...     sourcename='biscuit', version='1.0-1', distroseries=hoary)

    >>> biscuit_two_pub = test_publisher.getPubSource(
    ...     sourcename='biscuit', version='1.0-2', distroseries=hoary)

    >>> biscuit_three_pub = test_publisher.getPubSource(
    ...     sourcename='biscuit', version='1.0-3', distroseries=hoary)

Activate Foo Bar's PPA and upload another 'biscuit' source version.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     ArchivePurpose, IArchiveSet)
    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> ppa = getUtility(IArchiveSet).new(
    ...     owner=foobar, distribution=ubuntu, purpose=ArchivePurpose.PPA)

    >>> biscuit_four_pub = test_publisher.getPubSource(
    ...     sourcename='biscuit', version='1.0-4',
    ...     distroseries=hoary, archive=foobar.archive)

Creating corresponding `PackageDiff`s for all sources uploaded, except
the first one (new upload).

    >>> diff_one = biscuit_one_pub.sourcepackagerelease.requestDiffTo(
    ...     requester=name16,
    ...     to_sourcepackagerelease=biscuit_two_pub.sourcepackagerelease)

    >>> diff_two = biscuit_two_pub.sourcepackagerelease.requestDiffTo(
    ...     requester=name16,
    ...     to_sourcepackagerelease=biscuit_three_pub.sourcepackagerelease)

    >>> diff_three = biscuit_three_pub.sourcepackagerelease.requestDiffTo(
    ...     requester=name16,
    ...     to_sourcepackagerelease=biscuit_four_pub.sourcepackagerelease)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPackageDiffSet
    >>> diff_set = getUtility(IPackageDiffSet)
    >>> diffs = list(diff_set.getPendingDiffs())
    >>> for diff in diffs:
    ...     print diff.title
    1.0-1 to 1.0-2
    1.0-2 to 1.0-3
    1.0-3 (in Ubuntu) to 1.0-4

Perform some diffs in advance, the first diff in ubuntu and the diff
in PPA will be performed, the second diff in ubuntu will be performed
later.

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from canonical.database.constants import UTC_NOW
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.packagediff import (
    ...     PackageDiffStatus)
    >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient

    >>> def perform_fake_diff(diff, filename):
    ...     naked_diff = removeSecurityProxy(diff)
    ...     naked_diff.date_fulfilled = UTC_NOW
    ...     naked_diff.status = PackageDiffStatus.COMPLETED
    ...     naked_diff.diff_content = getUtility(ILibrarianClient).addFile(
    ...         filename, 3, StringIO('Foo'), 'application/gzipped-patch')
    ...     syncUpdate(diff)

    >>> perform_fake_diff(diff_one, 'biscuit_1.0-1_1.0-2.diff.gz')

    >>> perform_fake_diff(diff_three, 'biscuit_1.0-3_1.0-4.diff.gz')

Commit again, so the diffs will be available, and log out, we
are done here.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> logout()


== Ubuntu sources ==

All diffs are visible in the 'biscuit source in ubuntu' page, right
below the changelog text for each uploaded version.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/biscuit')
    >>> changes = find_tags_by_class(anon_browser.contents, 'boardComment')
    >>> for change in changes:
    ...     print 30 * '='
    ...     print extract_text(change)
    ==============================
    1.0-3
    Pending in hoary-release
    ...
    Available diffs
    1.0-2 to 1.0-3
    ==============================
    1.0-2
    Pending in hoary-release
    ...
    Available diffs
    1.0-1 to 1.0-2 (3 bytes)
    ==============================
    1.0-1
    Pending in hoary-release
    ...

Diffs already performed are rendered as link to the librarian file.

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('1.0-1 to 1.0-2').url
    http://.../biscuit_1.0-1_1.0-2.diff.gz

On the other hand, diffs not yet performed are rendered as plain text.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('1.0-2 to 1.0-3')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

When the remaining pending diff is performed and the page is reloaded
the missing link is rendered.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> diff_set = getUtility(IPackageDiffSet)
    >>> [diff] = diff_set.getPendingDiffs()
    >>> perform_fake_diff(diff, 'biscuit_1.0-2_1.0-3.diff.gz')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> logout()

    >>> anon_browser.reload()
    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('1.0-2 to 1.0-3').url
    http://.../biscuit_1.0-2_1.0-3.diff.gz

The same page section is presented in the corresponding
`DistributionSourcePackageRelease` pages

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('1.0-3').click()

    >>> diff_section = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     anon_browser.contents, 'diff-for-1.0-3')
    >>> print extract_text(diff_section)
    Available diffs
      1.0-2 to 1.0-3 (3 bytes)

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('1.0-2 to 1.0-3').url
    http://.../biscuit_1.0-2_1.0-3.diff.gz


== PPA diffs ==

PPA `PackageDiff` are exposed exactly in the same way ubuntu ones
are. They are presented in the expandable area right below the
corresponding source row in the PPA overview page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name16/+archive')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> biscuit_ppa = name16.archive.getPublishedSources()[0]
    >>> biscuit_ppa_id = biscuit_ppa.id
    >>> logout()

    >>> expander_url = anon_browser.getLink(
    ...     id='pub%s-expander' % biscuit_ppa_id).url
    >>> anon_browser.open(expander_url)
    >>> print extract_text(anon_browser.contents)
    Publishing details
    ...
    Available diffs
      1.0-3 (in Ubuntu) to 1.0-4 (3 bytes)
    ...

The text also link to the librarian file containing the diff.

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink(
    ...     '1.0-3 (in Ubuntu) to 1.0-4').url
    http://.../biscuit_1.0-3_1.0-4.diff.gz
