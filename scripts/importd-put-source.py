"""Upload a cscvs source tree to a remote repository of source trees.

usage: importd-put-source.py local_source remote_dir

local_source must be the absolute path where to find the local source tree to
upload.

remote_dir must be the URL of a directory. If that directory does not exist,
its parent must exist and the directory will be created. Then a
$local_source.tgs tarball will be created, uploaded to remote_dir as $(basename
local_source).tgz.swp, and finally renamed to $(basename local_source).tgz,
replacing the old tarball.

If remote_dir contains any name except $(basename local_source).tgz, they will
be deleted at the beginning of the script. That is needed because the bzrlib
SFTP tranport may use a temporary name during the upload and we do not want to
accumulate files left behind by interrupted uploads.

The basename of local_source is used to avoid confusing between cvs source
trees (cvsworking) and svn source trees (svnworking).
