Recipe Listing Pages
====================

Pages that want to display lists of recipes use the recipe-listing
page template, and views derived from RecipeListingView.


Branch Recipe Listings
======================

Create a branch and some recipes where the created branch is base_branch for
the recipe.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> branch = factory.makeBranch()
    >>> recipe1 = factory.makeSourcePackageRecipe(
    ...     None, None, None, None, None, None, branch)
    >>> recipe2 = factory.makeSourcePackageRecipe(
    ...     None, None, None, None, None, None, branch)
    >>> recipe3 = factory.makeSourcePackageRecipe(
    ...     None, None, None, None, None, None, branch)
    >>> branch_url = canonical_url(branch)
    >>> logout()

TODO: Test that "View source package recipes" doesn't show up when there are
none.

The branch page should have a link on it to view all the recipes that it is the
base_branch for.

    >>> anon_browser.open(branch_url)
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('View source package recipes').click()
    >>> print anon_browser.url
