        This will be used for the purpose of job dispatch time estimation

        In order to estimate the dispatch time for the JOI we need to
        calculate the sum of the estimated durations of the *pending* jobs
        ahead of JOI.

        Depending on the build farm job type the JOI may or may not be tied
        to a particular processor type.
        Binary builds for example are always built for a specific processor
        whereas "create a source package from recipe" type jobs do not care
        about processor types or virtualization.

        When implementing this method for processor independent build farm job
        types (e.g. recipe build) you may safely ignore the `processor` and
        `virtualized` parameters.

        The SELECT query to be returned needs to select the following data

            1 - BuildQueue.job
            2 - BuildQueue.lastscore
            3 - BuildQueue.estimated_duration
            4 - Processor.id    [optional]
            5 - virtualized     [optional]

        Please do *not* order the result set since it will be UNIONed and
        ordered only then.

        Job types that are processor independent or do not care about
        virtualization should return NULL for the optional data in the result
        set.

        :param min_score: the pending jobs selected by the returned
            query should have score >= min_score.
        :param processor: the type of processor that the jobs are expected
            to run on.

            `processor` natively or inside a virtual machine.
