= XMLRPC self-test API =

The Launchpad root object has a simple XMLRPC API to show that XMLRPC works.

We cannot currently test this going all the way through the XMLRPC http
publisher.  So, we'll test it by importing the view class, and using it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.xmlrpc import SelfTest, ISelfTest
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> selftestview = SelfTest('somecontext', 'somerequest')
    >>> verifyObject(ISelfTest, selftestview)
    True
    >>> selftestview.concatenate('foo', 'bar')
    u'foo bar'
    >>> selftestview.make_fault()
    <Fault 666: 'Yoghurt and spanners.'>
