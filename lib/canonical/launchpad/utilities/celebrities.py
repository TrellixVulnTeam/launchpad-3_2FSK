    This descriptor removes unnecessary boilerplate from the
    LaunchpadCelebrities attribute, as well as optimizing database
    access to ensure that using a celebrity causes at most one
    database query per request.

    TODO: By implementing a suitably clever wrapper, we should be able
    to reduce the queries further, as we will only ever need to really
    query the database if code attempts to access attributes of the
    celebrity besides the non-volatile id and name attributes. However,
    this is non trivial as we need to ensure that security and interface
    declarations remain unchanged. Perhaps we need a way of instantiating
    SQLObject instances in a 'lazy' mode? Or perhaps we should not worry
    about volatile attribute changes and pass a selectResults value through
    to the SQLObject.get method, which should allow us to instantiate a
    real instance without hitting the database. -- StuartBishop 20060123
