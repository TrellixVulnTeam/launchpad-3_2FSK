        <p>The colour coding of the translation status bar indicates the
        extent to which the app has been translated into that language.
        The colours describe messages that are either translated in the
        last-imported PO file (which would imply the translation is the
        same as the latest upstream version), updated in Rosetta, newly
        translated in Rosetta (and not yet upstream), or not translated
        at all.</p>
