== The nascent uploads ==

(First some setup. We need a librarian for this test.)

  >>> from canonical.librarian.ftests.harness import LibrarianTestSetup
  >>> LibrarianTestSetup().setUp()

We also need to set up the OpenPGP key used to sign things so that we can
identify the upload signer later on.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IGPGKeySet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import GPGKeyAlgorithm
  >>> discarded_key = getUtility(IGPGKeySet).new(26, '20687895',
  ...     '961F4EB829D7D304A77477822BC8401620687895', 1024, GPGKeyAlgorithm.D)

Next we import the test keys so we have them ready for verification

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

A nascent upload is a collection of files in a directory. They
represent what may turn out to be an acceptible upload to a launchpad
managed archive.

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUpload
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.uploadpolicy import findPolicyByName
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.tests import datadir

  >>> class MockLogger:
  ...     def debug(self, s):
  ...         print "DEBUG:", s

The policy we feed to to the nascent upload needs to have its command
line options passed in.

  >>> class MockOptions:
  ...     distro = "ubuntu"
  ...     distrorelease = "hoary"

  >>> class BuilddOptions(MockOptions):
  ...     buildid = 1

  >>> buildd_policy = findPolicyByName('buildd')
  >>> buildd_policy.setOptions(BuilddOptions())

When initially constructing a NascentUpload instance, it verifies that
the changes file specified exists, raising FileNotFound if it does not.

  >>> NascentUpload(buildd_policy, datadir(""), "DOES-NOT-EXIST",
  ...     MockLogger())
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  FileNotFound: DOES-NOT-EXIST
  >>> ed_upload = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('insecure'),
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.changes", MockLogger())
  >>> ed_upload.changes_filename == datadir("ed_0.2-20_i386.changes")
  True
  >>> ed_upload.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())

The nascent upload contains files (assuming it's sane) and as such we
have a NascentUploadedFile type to represent them.

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUploadedFile

To construct a nascentuploadedfile we need an fsroot and a line from a
Files section of a changes file.

  >>> nuf = NascentUploadedFile(
  ...     datadir(''),
  ...     ' 0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45 44718 editors important '
  ...     'ed_0.2-20_i386.deb')
  >>> nuf.filename
  'ed_0.2-20_i386.deb'
  >>> nuf._size
  44718
  >>> nuf._digest
  '0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45'
  >>> nuf.section
  'editors'
  >>> nuf.priority
  'important'

When we ask the object for its size or digest through the properties,
it will check them. If they're correct, no exception will be raised.

  >>> nuf.size
  44718
  >>> nuf.digest
  '0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45'
  >>> nuf.sha_digest
  'e5c467ca14ab67f73f8cbb9bb9016f670b14c8b7'
  >>> nuf._values_checked
  True

Going back to the upload itself, at a very basic level a NascentUpload
allows us to probe the contents of the changes file to see things like
the maintainer.

  >>> ed_upload.changes['maintainer']
  'James Troup <james@nocrew.org>'

We can also extract the list of files from the upload. If this raises
an exception then the file list is utterly broken.

  >>> for uploaded_file in ed_upload.files:
  ...     print uploaded_file.filename
  ed_0.2-20.dsc
  ed_0.2-20.diff.gz
  ed_0.2-20_i386.deb

The nascent upload can tell us if it is sourceful or not, (ditto binaryful)

  >>> ed_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_upload.binaryful
  True
  >>> ed_upload.archindep
  False
  >>> ed_upload.archdep
  True

  >>> ed_source_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.source-only-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger)
  >>> ed_source_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_source_upload.binaryful
  False

  >>> ed_binary_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.binary-only-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger)
  >>> ed_binary_upload.sourceful
  False
  >>> ed_binary_upload.binaryful
  True
  >>> ed_binary_upload.archdep
  True
  >>> ed_binary_upload.archindep
  False


If the Architecture line does not match then we get an exception.

  >>> ed_mismatched_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.mismatched-arch-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger())
  >>> ed_mismatched_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_mismatched_upload.rejection_message
  'Mismatch in binaryfulness. (arch) False != (files) True\nOne or more files uploaded with specific architecture but changes file does not list it.'

We can distinguish between the arch-indep and arch-dep binary uploads.

  >>> quodlibet = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "quodlibet_0.13.1-1_i386.changes", MockLogger())
  >>> quodlibet.sourceful
  False
  >>> quodlibet.binaryful
  True
  >>> quodlibet.archdep
  True
  >>> quodlibet.archindep
  True

We can ask sourceful uploads if they are native or not. If they are
not native we can find out if they have an orig.tar.gz or not.

  >>> ed_upload.native
  False
  >>> ed_upload.hasorig
  False

If we ask a non-sourceful upload about its native or hasorig status it
should throw an exception because non-sourceful uploads have no
concept of nativeness.

  >>> ed_binary_upload.native
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  UploadError: Attempted to ask a non-sourceful upload if it is native or not.


We can parse addresses and look them up in launchpad.

  >>> addr = ed_upload.parse_address("Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>")
  >>> addr['person'].displayname
  u'Foo Bar'

If the address is unparsable, we get an error.

  >>> ed_upload.parse_address("Cannot Parse Me <FOOO>")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  UploadError: Cannot Parse Me <FOOO>: no @ found in email address part.



The upload can extract distributions and distroreleases if it tries
  >>> ed_upload.distro.name
  u'ubuntu'
  >>> ed_upload.distrorelease.name
  u'hoary'

The policy we've used so far won't allow us to upload binary or
mixed-mode sets. We'll override this for our test set...

  >>> ed_upload.policy.can_upload_binaries = True
  >>> ed_upload.policy.can_upload_mixed = True

Finally we can ask the upload to process itself.
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageName, BinaryPackageName, DistroRelease)
  >>> hoary = DistroRelease.get(3)
  >>> saved_list = hoary.changeslist
  >>> hoary.changeslist = "dapper-announce@lists.ubuntu.com"
  >>> hoary.sync()
  >>> ed_upload.distrorelease.changeslist
  u'dapper-announce@lists.ubuntu.com'
  >>> ed_upload.process()
