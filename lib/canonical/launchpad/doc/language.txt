= LanguageSet =

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
  >>> language_set = getUtility(ILanguageSet)

== getLanguageByCode ==

We can get hold of languages by their language code.

  >>> language = language_set.getLanguageByCode('es')
  >>> language.englishname
  u'Spanish'

Or if it doesn't exist, we return None.

  >>> language_set.getLanguageByCode('not-existing') is None
  True

== canonicalise_language_code ==

We can convert language codes to standard form.

  >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt')
  'pt'
  >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt_BR')
  'pt_BR'
  >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt-br')
  'pt_BR'

== codes_to_languages ==

Convert a list of ISO language codes to language objects. If the code is
unknown, it's ignored.

  # 'zz' code doesn't exist:
  >>> language_set.getLanguageByCode('zz') is None
  True
  >>> languages = language_set.codes_to_languages(['es', 'pt_BR', 'zz'])
  >>> [language.englishname for language in languages]
  [u'Spanish', u'Portuguese (Brazil)']

== alt_suggestion_language ==

In some languages, you could reasonably expect to find good suggestions in a
second language. They might not be perfect but they are useful nonetheless.

pt_BR is not a descendent of pt:

    >>> pt_BR = language_set.getLanguageByCode('pt_BR')
    >>> print pt_BR.alt_suggestion_language
    None

However, es_MX would find es useful:

    >>> language = language_set.getLanguageByCode('es_MX')
    >>> print language.alt_suggestion_language.code
    es

And Nynorsk and Bokmal have a special relationship:

    >>> language = language_set.getLanguageByCode('nn')
    >>> print language.alt_suggestion_language.code
    nb

    >>> language = language_set.getLanguageByCode('nb')
    >>> print language.alt_suggestion_language.code
    nn

== dashedcode ==

Although we use underscores to separate language and country codes to
represent, for instance pt_BR, when used on web pages, it should use
instead a dash char. This method does it automatically:

  >>> pt_BR = language_set.getLanguageByCode('pt_BR')
  >>> print pt_BR.dashedcode
  pt-BR

== translators ==

This attribute has the list of persons that did some translations for this
language.

  >>> es = language_set.getLanguageByCode('es')
  >>> for translator in es.translators:
  ...     print translator.name
  carlos
