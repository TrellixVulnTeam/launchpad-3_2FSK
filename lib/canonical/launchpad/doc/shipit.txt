ShipIt
======

ShipIt is our application to ship Ubuntu CDs to our users. Any user can
make an request with any number of CDs, and as soon as the request is approved,
these CDs are sent to the user.

  >>> from datetime import date
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import (
  ...     ShipItFlavour, ShipItArchitecture, ShippingRequestStatus)
  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ShippingRun
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...    IStandardShipItRequestSet, IShippingRequestSet, IPersonSet,
  ...    IShippingRequest, ILaunchBag, ShippingRequestPriority)
  >>> requestset = getUtility(IShippingRequestSet)
  >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')

Let's create a new request for foo.bar@canonical.com.

  >>> UBUNTU = ShipItFlavour.UBUNTU
  >>> X86 = ShipItArchitecture.X86
  >>> AMD64 = ShipItArchitecture.AMD64
  >>> PPC = ShipItArchitecture.PPC
  >>> recipient = foobar
  >>> country = 31 # Brazil
  >>> city = 'Sao Carlos'
  >>> addressline1 = 'Antonio Rodrigues Cajado 1506'
  >>> name = 'Guilherme Salgado'
  >>> phone = '+551635015218'
  >>> reason = ("I'm going to give away some CDs in the next meeting of my "
  ...           "city's LUG.")
  >>> request = requestset.new(recipient, name, country, city,
  ...                          addressline1, phone, reason=reason)
  >>> quantities = {UBUNTU: {X86: 30, AMD64: 5, PPC: 2}}
  >>> request.setQuantities(quantities)

Note that we store a normalized version of the request's address, so that we
can identify people making requests from multiple different accounts.

  >>> request.normalized_address
  u'antoniorodriguescajado1506saocarlos'

A request can be a custom or a standard one; if the request contains custom
quantities for any flavour, then that request is considered custom.

  >>> request.containsCustomQuantitiesOfFlavour(ShipItFlavour.KUBUNTU)
  False
  >>> request.containsCustomQuantitiesOfFlavour(ShipItFlavour.UBUNTU)
  True
  >>> request.isCustom()
  True

We're not allowed to add a second request for the same recipient, while the
existing one is not yet exported.

  >>> request = requestset.new(recipient, name, country, city,
  ...                          addressline1, phone, reason=reason)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError

  >>> verifyObject(IShippingRequest, request)
  True

  >>> request.getTotalCDs()
  37
  >>> recipient.currentShipItRequest() == request
  True
  
If a request is not approved yet, it'll have its status == PENDING. If it
was approved, then status will be APPROVED.

  >>> request.status == ShippingRequestStatus.PENDING
  True

The number of CDs can be altered by the user, if he wants.

  >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
  >>> quantities = {UBUNTU: {X86: 10, AMD64: 3, PPC: 1}}
  >>> request.setQuantities(quantities)
  >>> request.getTotalCDs()
  14

When a request is approved, you must specify the approved quantities.

  >>> login('marilize@hbd.com')
  >>> request.approve(whoapproved=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
  >>> request.status == ShippingRequestStatus.APPROVED
  True
  >>> request.whoapproved.displayname
  u'Marilize Coetzee'
  >>> quantities = request.getRequestedCDsGroupedByFlavourAndArch()
  >>> quantities[UBUNTU][X86].quantityapproved
  10
  >>> quantities[UBUNTU][AMD64].quantityapproved
  3
  >>> quantities[UBUNTU][PPC].quantityapproved
  1

The approved quantities can be changed only if the request is approved.

  >>> quantities = {UBUNTU: {X86: 5, AMD64: 3, PPC: 2}}
  >>> request.setApprovedQuantities(quantities)
  >>> sorted([
  ...     (reqcds.flavour.name, reqcds.architecture.name,
  ...         reqcds.quantityapproved)
  ...     for reqcds in request.getAllRequestedCDs()
  ...     ])
  [('UBUNTU', 'AMD64', 3), ('UBUNTU', 'PPC', 2), ('UBUNTU', 'X86', 5)]

We can also mark a request as pending approval, automatically cleaning the
approved quantities.

  >>> request.clearApproval()
  >>> request.isAwaitingApproval()
  True
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> sorted([
  ...     (reqcds.flavour.name, reqcds.architecture.name,
  ...         reqcds.quantityapproved)
  ...     for reqcds in request.getAllRequestedCDs()
  ...     ])
  [('UBUNTU', 'AMD64', 0), ('UBUNTU', 'PPC', 0), ('UBUNTU', 'X86', 0)]

If a request hasn't been exported yet, it can still be denied.

  >>> request.deny()
  >>> request.isDenied()
  True

A request can also be cancelled, and this means the approved and
quantity*approved will be set back to None.

  >>> request.cancel(getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
  >>> request.isCancelled()
  True
  >>> request.whocancelled.displayname
  u'Marilize Coetzee'
  >>> flush_database_updates()

When a request is cancelled it'll not show up as the recipient's current
request.

  >>> recipient.currentShipItRequest() is None
  True

Instead, it'll be part of the past requests of that recipient.

  >>> request in recipient.pastShipItRequests()
  True


Searching for requests
----------------------

We have 16 requests, and two of them are cancelled

  >>> sorted((shipreq.id, shipreq.recipient.name) 
  ...        for shipreq in requestset.search())
  [(1, u'no-priv'), (2, u'stub'), (3, u'kreutzm'), (4, u'lifeless'),
   (5, u'ddaa'), (6, u'cprov'), (7, u'debonzi'), (12, u'jdub'),
   (13, u'shipit-admins'), (14, u'jblack'), (15, u'ddaa'),
   (16, u'jordi'), (17, u'jblack'), (18, u'ddaa'), (19, u'shipit-admins'),
   (20, u'sabdfl'), (21L, u'name16')]

  >>> cancelled = ShippingRequestStatus.CANCELLED
  >>> sorted((shipreq.id, shipreq.recipient.name) 
  ...        for shipreq in requestset.search(status=cancelled))
  [(6, u'cprov'), (21L, u'name16')]

Two of them are pending review, because their recipients asked for extra CDs.

  >>> pending = ShippingRequestStatus.PENDING
  >>> for request in requestset.search(status=pending):
  ...     print request.id, ":", request.reason
  12 : I want 100 more CDs.
  13 : I need 50 more CDs to give away to my friends.

Eight are approved but not yet shipped.
  
  >>> approved = ShippingRequestStatus.APPROVED
  >>> sorted((shipreq.id, shipreq.recipient.name) 
  ...         for shipreq in requestset.search(status=approved))
  [(1, u'no-priv'), (2, u'stub'), (3, u'kreutzm'), (4, u'lifeless'),
   (5, u'ddaa'), (7, u'debonzi'), (16, u'jordi'), (19, u'shipit-admins')]

And finally, four of them are already shipped.

  >>> shipped = ShippingRequestStatus.SHIPPED
  >>> sorted((shipreq.id, shipreq.recipient.name) 
  ...         for shipreq in requestset.search(status=shipped))
  [(14, u'jblack'), (15, u'ddaa'), (17, u'jblack'), (18, u'ddaa')]


It's also possible to search for requests containing CDs of a given flavour or
of a given distroseries (or both, obviously).

  >>> kubuntu = ShipItFlavour.KUBUNTU
  >>> [(shipreq.recipient.displayname , shipreq.id)
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(flavour=kubuntu)]
  [(u'Celso Providelo', 6), (u'David Allouche', 5),
   (u'Daniel Henrique Debonzi', 7), (u'Jordi Mallach', 16),
   (u'James Blackwell', 17), (u'ShipIt Administrators', 19)]

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import ShipItDistroSeries
  >>> feisty = ShipItDistroSeries.FEISTY
  >>> [(shipreq.recipient.displayname , shipreq.id)
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(distroseries=feisty)]
  [(u'Robert Collins', 4), (u'No Privileges Person', 1),
   (u'Celso Providelo', 6), (u'Mark Shuttleworth', 20),
   (u'Helge Kreutzmann', 3), (u'David Allouche', 5),
   (u'Daniel Henrique Debonzi', 7), (u'David Allouche', 18),
   (u'Jordi Mallach', 16), (u'Jeff Waugh', 12),
   (u'ShipIt Administrators', 13), (u'James Blackwell', 17),
   (u'Stuart Bishop', 2), (u'Foo Bar', 21L)]

  >>> edubuntu = ShipItFlavour.EDUBUNTU
  >>> [(shipreq.recipient.displayname , shipreq.id)
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(distroseries=feisty, flavour=edubuntu)]
  [(u'David Allouche', 18), (u'Jordi Mallach', 16),
   (u'ShipIt Administrators', 13)]

  >>> edgy = ShipItDistroSeries.EDGY
  >>> [(shipreq.recipient.displayname , shipreq.id)
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(distroseries=edgy)]
  [(u'ShipIt Administrators', 19)]


Another way of searching is by using any part of the recipient's name or the
beginning of his email address.

  >>> [shipreq.recipient.displayname 
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(recipient_text='Kreutzmann')]
  [u'Helge Kreutzmann']

  >>> [shipreq.recipient_email
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(recipient_text='Stuart.Bishop')]
  [u'stuart.bishop@canonical.com']

  >>> [shipreq.recipient_email
  ...  for shipreq in requestset.search(status=ShippingRequestStatus.PENDING,
  ...                                   recipient_text='marilize')]
  ['info@shipit.ubuntu.com']


== Standard request templates ==

We want most of the people to use the standard options we provide when making
new requests, because if we give them a text field for entering the quantity,
lots of people will just enter as many as they can, just because they can.

These options are presented as a set of radio buttons and their visibility
changes according to the logged in user. That is, some users get to see all
options while others can see only the options with at most N CDs.

    >>> sabdfl = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> sabdfl.is_trusted_on_shipit
    True
    >>> optionset = getUtility(IStandardShipItRequestSet)
    >>> for option in optionset.getByFlavour(ShipItFlavour.UBUNTU, sabdfl):
    ...     print option.description
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 64-bit PC Edition)
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 Mac Edition)
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 PC Edition)
    5 Ubuntu CDs (5 PC Edition)
    10 Ubuntu CDs (8 PC Edition, 1 64-bit PC Edition, 1 Mac Edition)
    10 Ubuntu CDs (10 PC Edition)

    >>> jdub = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jdub')
    >>> jdub.is_trusted_on_shipit
    False
    >>> for option in optionset.getByFlavour(ShipItFlavour.UBUNTU, jdub):
    ...     print option.description
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 64-bit PC Edition)
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 Mac Edition)
    1 Ubuntu CD (1 PC Edition)
    5 Ubuntu CDs (5 PC Edition)

== Exporting requests ==

When exporting requests, we'll want to get all approved requests that weren't
approved yet, with a given priority. This is done using the
getUnshippedRequestsIDs method of ShippingRequestSet.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> high = ShippingRequestPriority.HIGH
  >>> unshipped_requests = requestset.getUnshippedRequestsIDs(high)
  >>> len(unshipped_requests)
  1

To actually export the files and upload them to Librarian we use
ShippingRequestSet.exportRequestsToFiles(). Let's do an export of all high
priority requests.

  >>> requestset.exportRequestsToFiles(high, transaction)
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> run = ShippingRun.select(orderBy='-id', limit=1)[0]
  >>> run.requests_count
  1
  >>> run.requests[0].highpriority
  True

  >>> def pprint_csv(content):
  ...     lines = content.split('\n')
  ...     headings = [heading.replace('"', '').strip()
  ...                 for heading in lines.pop(0).split('",')]
  ...     longest_heading = max(map(len, headings))
  ...     count = 1
  ...     for line in lines:
  ...         if not line or line.isspace():
  ...             continue
  ...         print "-" * 60, 'Line %d' % count
  ...         count += 1
  ...         fields = [field.replace('"', '').strip()
  ...                   for field in line.split('",')]
  ...         for idx in range(len(fields)):
  ...             format = "%%%ds" % longest_heading
  ...             heading = format % headings[idx]
  ...             value = fields[idx]
  ...             try:
  ...                 float(value)
  ...                 try:
  ...                     int(value)
  ...                 except ValueError:
  ...                     # This is a numeric value and is not an integer, so
  ...                     # we'll round it to two decimal places.
  ...                     value = "%.4s" % value
  ...             except ValueError:
  ...                 pass
  ...             print "%s: %s" % (heading, value)

  >>> pprint_csv(run.csvfile.read())
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 1
                          recordnr: 16

          ship Kubuntu quantity PC: 5
   ship Kubuntu quantity 64-bit PC: 0
         ship Kubuntu quantity Mac: 0
         ship Edubuntu quantity PC: 5
  ship Edubuntu quantity 64-bit PC: 0
        ship Edubuntu quantity Mac: 0
                             token: ...
                          Ship via: TNT
                           display: 0


Now we do an export of all normal priority requests that are ready to be
shipped, by running the shipit-exports cronscript.

  >>> sorted(requestset.getUnshippedRequestsIDs(ShippingRequestPriority.NORMAL))
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

  >>> import subprocess
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
  ...     'cronscripts/shipit-exports.py -q --priority=normal', shell=True,
  ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
  >>> out, err
  ('', '')
  >>> process.returncode
  0

  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> len(requestset.getUnshippedRequestsIDs(ShippingRequestPriority.NORMAL))
  0
  >>> run = ShippingRun.select(orderBy='-datecreated', limit=1)[0]
  >>> sorted([request.id for request in run.requests])
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

  >>> run.requests[0].highpriority
  False

Generating reports
------------------

To help Jane with marketing decisions, we need to generate periodic reports
based on shipit data.

One of the reports we can generate gives us information about orders shipped
to each country.

The generateCountryBasedReport() method accepts a current_release_only
argument that, if True, will include only requests of
ShipItConstants.current_distroseries.

  >>> csv_file = requestset.generateCountryBasedReport(
  ...     current_release_only=False)
  >>> pprint_csv(csv_file.read())

There's another report which gives us the number of shipments of all shipment
sizes we had.

The generateShipmentSizeBasedReport() method accepts a current_release_only
argument that, if True, will include only requests of
ShipItConstants.current_distroseries.

  >>> csv_file = requestset.generateShipmentSizeBasedReport(
  ...     current_release_only=False)
  >>> pprint_csv(csv_file.read())
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 1
        Number of CDs: 1
  Number of Shipments: 2
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 2
        Number of CDs: 2
  Number of Shipments: 1
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 3
        Number of CDs: 5
  Number of Shipments: 2
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 4
        Number of CDs: 10
  Number of Shipments: 4
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 5
        Number of CDs: 24
  Number of Shipments: 2

  >>> csv_file = requestset.generateShipmentSizeBasedReport(
  ...     current_release_only=True)
  >>> pprint_csv(csv_file.read())
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 1
        Number of CDs: 1
  Number of Shipments: 2
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 2
        Number of CDs: 2
  Number of Shipments: 1

        Number of CDs: 5
  Number of Shipments: 2
  ------------------------------------------------------------ Line 4
        Number of CDs: 10
  Number of Shipments: 4


There's also a report of requests by week, which can be tweaked to report only
requests for CDs of the current distroseries or all requests.

  >>> start_date = date(2006, 2, 24)
  >>> end_date = date(2006, 4, 3)
  >>> csv_file = requestset.generateWeekBasedReport(
  ...     start_date, end_date, only_current_distroseries=True)

To help identifying if we're reaching new users with every release, we have a
report which shows the distribution of requests. Both for the current release
and to the previous one.

  >>> csv_file = requestset.generateRequestDistributionReport()

  # Skip the first two lines since they have headers which are supposed to
  # span across multiple columns, screwing our pprint_csv() function.
  >>> header1, header2, content = csv_file.read().split('\n', 2)
  >>> print header1
  "","","Current Release Only","","","","","Previous Releases Only",""
  >>> print header2
  "","requests","","shipped","","requests","","shipped",""
  >>> pprint_csv(content)

All these reports are generated periodically and stored in the Librarian by
the shipit-reports cronscript.
