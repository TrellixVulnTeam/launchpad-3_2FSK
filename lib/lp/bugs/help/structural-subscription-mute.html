    <h1>What happens when I disable delivery?</h1>

    <p>
      Sometimes you will be subscribed to a bug target (like a project) via a
      team subscription, but you may not want to revieve the notifications.  If
      so, you can disable the delivery of the messages to yourself without
      affecting the other team members.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if a team delivers its bug messages via a mailing list or some
      other preferred email, disabling email delivery will not be honored
      because doing so would prevent the other team members from recieving the
      notifications.
