= Empty source package branch listings =

When you look at an empty source package branch listing, you see some nice,
helpful text.

Let's demonstrate this by making a source package with no branches and
browsing to it.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> source_package = factory.makeSourcePackage()
    >>> source_package_url = canonical_url(source_package, rootsite='code')
    >>> logout()

This takes us to the branch listing for that source package

    >>> browser.open(source_package_url)
    >>> print browser.title
    ''
