Published Package
-----------------

This database view gives us information on which packages are published in
which distributions.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPublishedPackageSet
    >>> pp_set = getUtility(IPublishedPackageSet)

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> verifyObject(IPublishedPackageSet, pp_set)
    True

There are also some meta objects to combine information from the DB
model in more intuitive ones:

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
 ...     IDistroReleaseBinaryPackage)

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import SourcePackageRelease
 >>> src = SourcePackageRelease.get(20)
 >>> src.name
 u'pmount'

 >>> verifyObject(IDistroReleaseBinaryPackage, src.meta_binaries[0])
 True
