Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with %(language)s translations for %(template)s to Launchpad.

We were unable to import it because it declares more plural forms than
Launchpad can currently handle.  The maximum supported is %(max_plural_forms)d.

Please see if you can get by with fewer plural forms.  You can find Launchpad's default plural-forms information for %(language)s here:

https://translations.launchpad.net/+languages/%(language_code)s

If you believe the information listed there is incorrect, please file a question here:

https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:
%(file_link)s


Thank you,

The Launchpad team
