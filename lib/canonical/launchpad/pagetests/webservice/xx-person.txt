= People =

Basic operations on people are described in xx-collections.txt. This
document shows some of the other features of a person.

== Modification ==

A person can be modified.

  >>> import simplejson
  >>> def patch_salgado(patch):
  ...     return webservice(r"""
  ... PATCH /people/salgado HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... Content-type: application/json
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ...
  ... %s
  ... """ % simplejson.dumps(patch))


  >>> salgado = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/salgado HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'Guilherme Salgado'

  >>> print patch_salgado({'displayname' : 'GUILHERME SALGADO'})
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: 0
  ...

  >>> salgado = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/salgado HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'GUILHERME SALGADO'

A person's read-only attributes can't be modified.

  >>> print patch_salgado({'datecreated' : 'dummy-date'})
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Length: 55
  Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  You tried to modify the read-only attribute datecreated


== Team memberships ==

A person is linked to their team memberships.

  >>> salgado['team_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships'

Similarly, a team is linked to the team memberships of its members.

  >>> landscape_developers = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> landscape_developers['member_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/landscape-developers/member_memberships'

Team memberships are first-class objects with their own URLs.

  >>> salgado_memberships = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/salgado/team_memberships HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in sorted(salgado_memberships)]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships/admins',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships/landscape-developers']

Team memberships also have data fields.

  >>> salgado_landscape = sorted(salgado_memberships)[1]
  >>> sorted(salgado_landscape)
  [u'date_expires', u'date_joined', u'member_link',
   u'reviewer_comment', u'reviewer_link', u'self_link', u'status',
   u'team_link']

Each team membership links to the person who approved the link.

  >>> salgado_landscape['reviewer_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/name16'

Also to the person whose membership it is.

  >>> salgado_landscape['member_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado'

Also to the team in which the membership is valid.

  >>> salgado_landscape['team_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/landscape-developers'

A TeamMembership relates a person to a team, and the relationship
works both ways. You've already seen how the representation of a
person includes a link to that person's team memberships. But it's
possible to navigate from a team, to the collection of peoples'
memberships in the team.

  >>> landscape_memberships = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers/member_memberships HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()

  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in sorted(landscape_memberships)]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/name12/team_memberships/landscape-developers',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships/landscape-developers']

A list of team memberships is distinct from a list of a team's
members. Members are people; memberships are TeamMemberships. You've
seen the memberships for the 'landscape-developers' team above; here
are the members.

  >>> landscape_members = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers/members HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in sorted(landscape_members)]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/name12']
