BugWatchActivity
================

The activity on a given bug watch is recorded in the BugWatchActivity
table.

We can create a new BugWatchActivity record for a bug watch using that
BugWatch's addActivity() method.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.lpstorm import IStore
    >>> from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
    >>> from lp.bugs.model.bugwatch import BugWatchActivity

In order to create a BugWatch to test with we need to switch DB users.
This is because the checkwatches DB user can't create BugWatches, whilst
at the same time _only_ the checkwatches DB user can create
BugWatchActivity instances.

    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser('launchpad')
    >>> bug_watch = factory.makeBugWatch(remote_bug='42')

    >>> # This commit is unavoidable, otherwise we lose the watch when we
    >>> # switch users.
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(config.checkwatches.dbuser)

When a BugWatch is first created there has been no activity on it.

    >>> print bug_watch.activity.count()
    0

    >>> bug_watch.addActivity()
    >>> store = IStore(BugWatchActivity)
    >>> store.flush()

We can access the BugWatchActivity record by looking at the BugWatch's
activity property.

    >>> print bug_watch.activity.count()
    1

    >>> activity = bug_watch.activity.first()
    >>> activity.bug_watch == bug_watch
    True

The BugWatchActivity's activity_date will be set automatically when it
is written to the database.

    >>> activity.activity_date
    datetime.datetime...

The other fields on the BugWatchActivity record, which aren't required,
will all be None.

    >>> print activity.result
    None
    >>> print activity.message
    None
    >>> print activity.oops_id
    None


Recording BugWatch updates as BugWatchActivity
-----------------------------------------------

Whenever an update is made to a BugWatch that update is recorded as a
BugWatchActivity entry.

We can demonstrate this by passing our bug watch to
BugWatchUpdater.updateBugWatches().

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.logger import QuietFakeLogger
    >>> from lp.bugs.scripts.checkwatches import BugWatchUpdater
    >>> from lp.bugs.tests.externalbugtracker import TestExternalBugTracker
    >>> updater = BugWatchUpdater(transaction, QuietFakeLogger())
    >>> updater.updateBugWatches(
    ...     TestExternalBugTracker('http://example.com'), [bug_watch])

An extra activity item will have been added to the BugWatch's activity
property.

    >>> print bug_watch.activity.count()
    2
