= Feeds Navigation =

Feeds are served over HTTP, and are heavily cached. Pages which are not
registered on the Feeds layer should not be served from the feeds.lp.n
subdomain. When bug 150941 is fixed, this test should be changed to show 
that the navigation is fixed and we get a 404 here.

== Index of a product ==

    >>> browser.open('http://feeds.launchpad.dev/jokosher')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://feeds.launchpad.dev/jokosher'

== Redirection ==

We expect that people may manually enter feed URLs, since they follow
a predictable pattern. If someone enters a feed URL and it has
uppercase letters in it, we redirect to the canonical form of the URL
before serving the page.

   >>> browser.open('http://feeds.launchpad.dev/jOkOshEr')
   >>> browser.url
   'http://feeds.launchpad.dev/jokosher'

== Query String Normalization ==

If multiple urls contain the same query string with the same arguments
in a different order, we want to redirect the user to the url with
the normalized query string, so that there is only one cached copy that
has to be refreshed.

    >>> browser.open('http://feeds.launchpad.dev/bugs/search-bugs.atom?'
    ...     'field.scope=all&search=Search+Bug+Reports&aaa=foo')
    >>> browser.url
    '...search-bugs.atom?aaa=foo&field.scope=all&search=Search+Bug+Reports'
