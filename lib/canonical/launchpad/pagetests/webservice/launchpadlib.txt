Using launchpadlib in pagetests
===============================

As an alternative to crafting HTTP requests with the 'webservice'
object, you can write pagetests using launchpadlib. The 'launchpad'
variable contains a launchpadlib Launchpad object that's
pre-authenticated with salgado's permissions. Anything you can do with
'webservice', you can do with 'launchpad'.

  >>> print launchpad.me.name
  salgado
