===================
Publishing Security
===================

The source publication record, SourcePackagePublishingHistory has a
security adapter that prevents viewing by unauthorised people.  For
publications attached to a public archive, there are no restrictions.
For those attached to a private archive, only those able to view the
archive, or admins, can see the publication.

As an anonymous user get the first published source out of cprov's 
public PPA:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> cprov_ppa = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov').archive
    >>> cprov_ppa.private
    False

    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    >>> print source_pub.displayname
    cdrkit 1.0 in breezy-autotest

A regular user can see it too:

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    >>> print source_pub.displayname
    cdrkit 1.0 in breezy-autotest

Now, we'll make cprov's PPA private:

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> cprov_ppa.private = True
    >>> cprov_ppa.buildd_secret = "blah"

Anonymous access will now be refused:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

As is for a regular user.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

But cprov himself can see it:

    >>> login('celso.providelo@canonical.com')
    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    >>> print source_pub.displayname
    cdrkit 1.0 in breezy-autotest

As can an administrator.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> source_pub = cprov_ppa.getPublishedSources()[0]
    >>> print source_pub.displayname
    cdrkit 1.0 in breezy-autotest
