      Nobody has yet proposed any blueprints for discussion at this sprint.
      If you will be attending the sprint you should make sure that the
      blueprints you are interested in discussing get nominated for the
      agenda. You can do this using the "Propose for meeting agenda" action
      link on the blueprint page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each meeting has a person, or team, responsible for deciding which
      items are accepted for the agenda. This team is called the "meeting
      driver" and for <tal:meeting replace="context/title" /> they are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="person" tal:repeat="driver context/drivers">
        <a tal:attributes="href driver/fmt:url"
           tal:content="driver/browsername" />
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should contact the meeting driver if you have any additional
      questions about the structure or agenda of the meeting.
