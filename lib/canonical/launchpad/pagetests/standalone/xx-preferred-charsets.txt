In order to minimise problems related to page encodings, we want all
our pages to always be encoded using utf-8, even if the client says
that he doesn't accept it.

    >>> anon_browser.addHeader('Accept-Charset', 'iso8859-1')
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> anon_browser.headers['Content-Type']
    'text/html;charset=utf-8'

The status is still 200, instead of 406 which is recommended, since it's
better to send the page as it is, letting the client deal with the error
handling. If we would set the status to 406, most browsers would display
an (hard to understand) error page instead of the actual page contents.

    >>> anon_browser.headers['status']
    '200 Ok'
