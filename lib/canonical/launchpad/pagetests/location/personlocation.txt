= Person Locations =

People can have a location and time zone in Launchpad.  In some cases, a
person has a time zone, but no location. We test that their home page renders
without problems.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> zzz = factory.makePerson(name='zzz', time_zone='Africa/Maseru',
    ...                          latitude=None, longitude=None)
    >>> logout()
    >>> nopriv_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~zzz')

They should see a link to the +editlocation page (around the map image)
and the person's time zone.

    >>> editlink = nopriv_browser.getLink(url='+editlocation')
    >>> editlink.text
    '[IMG]'
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(nopriv_browser.contents, 'portlet-map'))
    Location
    Time zone: Africa/Maseru

If a person has a location, they should have a little map portlet in their
home page. We can't test all the google javascript, but we can make sure
there's a map, and the scripts are loaded.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> yyy = factory.makePerson(name='yyy', time_zone='Europe/London',
    ...                          latitude=52.2, longitude=0.3)
    >>> logout()
    >>> nopriv_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~yyy')
    >>> markup = str(nopriv_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(markup, 'portlet-map'))
    Location
    Time zone: Europe/London...
    Y.LP.mapping.renderPersonMapSmall(...
    >>> 'src="http://maps.google.com/maps' in markup
    True
    >>> 'build/lp/mapping.js' in markup
    True
