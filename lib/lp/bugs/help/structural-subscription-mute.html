    <h1>What happens when I stop delivery?</h1>

    <p>
      Sometimes you will have bug subscriptions via a team and you no longer
      want to receive the emails.  If so, you can disable the delivery of the
      messages to yourself without affecting the other team members.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if a team delivers its bug messages via a mailing list or some
      other preferred email, disabling email delivery will not be honored
      because doing so would prevent the other team members from receiving the
      notifications.
