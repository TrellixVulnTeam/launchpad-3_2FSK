OK so far.

lrwxrwxrwx ian/ian           0 Mar  3 04:35 1995 b -> a
tar: Could not create symlink to a : File exists

Ooops.  tar should have overwritten b (silently).

chiark:~/junk> rm b

lrwxrwxrwx ian/ian           0 Mar  3 04:35 1995 b -> a
tar: Could not create symlink to a : File exists

It can't overwrite a plain file with link.

chiark:~/junk> ll a b

OK, put the file in the archive.

chiark:~/junk> tar vvxf t
-rw-rw-r-- ian/ian           3 Mar  3 04:36 1995 b

And we can extract it.

chiark:~/junk> rm a b
rm: a: No such file or directory
chiark:~/junk> ln -s a b

Make the link.

chiark:~/junk> tar vvxf t
-rw-rw-r-- ian/ian           3 Mar  3 04:36 1995 b

Now when we extract it follows the link !  Aargh !  This is horrible.
