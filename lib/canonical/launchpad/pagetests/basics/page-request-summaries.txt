Launchpad pages end with a comment that displays how many queries we've issued
to render the page. Note that we say "at least" because unfortunately
some queries may be issued after the page may finish rendering -- the
authoritative source is in OOPS reports or in the web app's stderr.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...<!-- at least ... queries issued in ... seconds -->...

It's available for any page:


  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~mark/')
  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...<!-- at least ... queries issued in ... seconds -->...
