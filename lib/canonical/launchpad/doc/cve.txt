Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
==========================================

Malone supports attaching CVE references to bugs. From
http://www.cve.mitre.org/about/ CVE is:

    A list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and other
    information security exposures - CVE aims to standardize the names
    for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures.

For more information, consult the CVE website:

    http://www.cve.mitre.org/

Creating CVE entries
--------------------

CVE references can be created with the ICveSet utility.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login("test@canonical.com")

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ICveSet
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import CveStatus
    >>> cveset = getUtility(ICveSet)

To create a CVE, call ICveSet.new(sequence, description,
    status=CveStatus.CANDIDATE)

    >>> cve = cveset.new(sequence="2004-0276",
    ...     description="A new CVE", status=CveStatus.ENTRY,
    ...     )
    >>> cve.displayname
    u'CVE-2004-0276'

Linking CVE's to Bugs
=====================

You can link a CVE to a bug. You can also see which CVE's are currently
linked to a bug:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Bug
    >>> b = Bug.get(1)
    >>> for c in b.cves:
    ...     print c.displayname
    CVE-1999-8979

Let's add the new CVE:

    >>> len(b.cves)
    1
    >>> b.linkCVE(cve)
    <BugCve at ...>
    >>> len(b.cves)
    2

Ah, but that was a bad idea. Let's unlink it.

    >>> b.unlinkCVE(cve)
    >>> len(b.cves)
    1
