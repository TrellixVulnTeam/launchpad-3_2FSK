= POFile statistics =

We frequently display statistics about POFiles: how many of its messages
remain untranslated, how many have been changed in Launchpad, how many have
had suggested translations submitted that need to be reviewed?

It takes too long to gather these statistics on demand, so we cache them in
POFile fields.  When translations are changed, these statistics can be either
updated incrementally or recomputed altogether.

Incremental updates carry a risk of errors creeping in and being preserved
even during some updates.  That's why a cron job trawls the POFile table,
recomputing translation statistics and noting any divergence between the
cached values and the ones it recomputes from scratch.

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> import sys
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
    ...     sys.executable, 'cronscripts/rosetta-pofile-stats.py', '-v'],
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
    >>> print output
    INFO creating lockfile
    INFO Starting verification of POFile stats at id 0

    INFO Done.

Since old data will probably change less, the machinery supports partial runs
skipping POFiles whose id is lower than some given value.  This may be
useful for optimization: we can decide to schedule more frequent runs on
newer data, or we can choose to do a quick manual run if we believe some
recent POFile(s) to have incorrect statistics data.

Since we just ran the cron script on the full table, all our statistics are
now in order.  We verify POFiles starting at id 30, and see no warnings.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.verify_pofile_stats import (
    ...     VerifyPOFileStatsProcess)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> verifier = VerifyPOFileStatsProcess(transaction, logger, 30)
    >>> verifier.run()
    INFO Starting verification of POFile stats at id 30
    INFO Done.

If for any reason any POFiles' statistics are found to be wrong, the
differences will be reported.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.pofile import POFile
    >>> pofile = POFile.get(34)
    >>> pofile.getStatistics()
    (0, 0, 3, 0)
    >>> pofile.rosettacount = 999
    >>> verifier = VerifyPOFileStatsProcess(transaction, logger, 34)
    >>> verifier.run()
    INFO Starting verification of POFile stats at id 34
    WARNING POFile 34:
    cached stats were (0, 0, 999, 0), recomputed as (0, 0, 3, 0)
    INFO Done.
