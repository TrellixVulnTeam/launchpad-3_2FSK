= IFAQCollection Interface =

The Launchpad Answer Tracker can be used to track answers to commonly
asked questions. Regular user questions can then be answered with a
referral to the FAQ document.

Objects that represents collection of FAQs provides the IFAQCollection
interface.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IFAQCollection

    >>> verifyObject(IFAQCollection, collection)
    True

== Population FAQs collection ==

The IFAQCollection interface is a read-only interface. The IFAQTarget
interface is used for creating FAQs (see faqtarget.txt for details).

Since not all IFAQCollections are IFAQTarget, we rely on the harness
to provide us with a newFAQ() function that can be used to add a FAQ to
the collection.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> no_priv = personset.getByName('no-priv')
    >>> foo_bar = personset.getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = personset.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> faq_specifications = [
    ...     (no_priv, 'How do I install Foo?',
    ...      'See http://www.foo.org/install', 'foo install'),
    ...     (sample_person, 'What is The Meaning of Life?',
    ...      'A Monthy Python film!', 'film monthy python'),
    ...     (no_priv, 'How do I make money quickly off the Internet?',
    ...      "Spamalot with an offer that gullible users can't refuse.",
    ...      None),
    ...     (foo_bar, 'How do I play the Game of Life?',
    ...      'Keep breathing!', None),
    ...     (sample_person, 'Who really shot JFK?',
    ...     'You decide: there were at least six conspiracies going on '
    ...     'in Dallas on Nov 22nd 1963.', None),
    ...     (no_priv, 'What were the famous last words?',
    ...      'Who closed the light?', None)
    ... ]

    >>> faq_set = []
    >>> for owner, title, content, keywords in faq_specifications:
    ...     faq_set.append(newFAQ(owner, title, content, keywords))

== getFAQ() ==

It is possible to retrieve a FAQ in a colletion using its id by using
the getFAQ() method.

    >>> faq = faq_set[0]
    >>> collection.getFAQ(faq.id) == faq
    True

It returns None when there is FAQ with that ID in the context:

    >>> print collection.getFAQ(12345)
    None

It also returns None when asking an ID for a FAQ that isn't in the
requested collection:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, ILaunchBag)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> ubuntu != collection
    True
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> foo_bar = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu_faq = ubuntu.newFAQ(
    ...     foo_bar, 'Ubuntu Installation HowTo',
    ...     'Ubuntu installation procedure can be found at: '
    ...     'https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation')

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> print collection.getFAQ(ubuntu_faq.id)
    None
