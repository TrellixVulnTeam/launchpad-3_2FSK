    <h1>Translation working modes</h1>

    <p>
      When you have full access to translations, all your new translations
      will be automatically applied as the new current translations. This is
      the desire result when reviewing others translations or working in
      small teams. Adding a new suggestion will require to explicitly check
      the "Someone needs to review this translation" checkbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      When working in teams using a peer review process as a measurement 
      translations quality assurance, the previously described behaviour
      is not suitable, as you will have to manually check the
      "Someone needs to review this translation" checkbox after adding
      each new translation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To deal with these different use cases, the following working modes
      are available to persons with full access to translations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reviewer:</strong> This is the default working mode.
      All changes will be automatically approved as new translations. In order
      to add a suggestion, you will have to manually check the "Someone needs
      to review this translation" checkbox.</li>
      <li><strong>Translator:</strong> When entering new translations, the
      "Someone needs to review this translation" checkbox will be
      automatically checked and the new translations will be added as
      suggestions. In order to apply the new translation, you will have to
      manually uncheck the "Someone needs to review this translation"
      checkbox.</li>
    </ul>
