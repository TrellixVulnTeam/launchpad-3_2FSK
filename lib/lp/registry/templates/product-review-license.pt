        <h2>Granting approval</h2>

        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>Does the project use any Launchpad services, such as code or
              bugs?  Mark the <strong>project approved</strong>
              and <strong>reviewed</strong> now.
          </li>
          <li>Are the project's licenses simple and obviously open source
              and/or free software?  Does the project smell legitimate?  Mark
              the <strong>project approved</strong>
              and <strong>reviewed</strong> now.
          </li>
          <li>Does the project appear legitimate but incomplete?  That's fine,
              mark the <strong>project approved</strong>
              and <strong>reviewed</strong> now.  Consider also sending a
              request to the
              owner asking them to update the project with more details, so as
              to help recruit contributors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Withholding approval</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few reasons you may want to withhold approval.  You
          should always contact the project owner for clarification if you do
          not grant approval.
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>The project has no license.</li>
          <li>The project has only <strong>Other/Open source</strong> selected
              as a license and the license info field does not contain a URL
              to a license, or contains the whole license.
          </li>
          <li>The <strong>Other/Open source</strong> license appears to
              discriminate against who can use the project, or how the
              project's work can be used.
          </li>
          <li>The project details are too vague to know if it is legitimate.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>If the project looks like a test, a prank, or spam,
          deactivate it.</strong>
