So now No Privileges Person is the Afrikaans translator for the PolyGlot
translation group, and they are the translation group for Ubuntu, which has
Closed translations. This means that No Privileges Person should be able to
translate any strings in Ubuntu to Afrikaans. In other languages, No
Privileges Person should be warned that he is not a designated translator.

Let's see if No Privileges Person can see the translated strings in Southern
Sotho. We expect them to be told they can only make contributions:

  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/st/+translate')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/st/+translate'
  >>> 'Your translations will be held for review' in browser.contents
  True

However, in Afrikaans, No Privileges Person DOES have the ability to edit
directly.

First, we show that the message 137 is not translated.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/8/+translate')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/8/+translate'
  >>> '(no translation yet)' in browser.contents
  True

Now, we need to show that it is translated after a post. Let's go ahead and
POST and see that all goes well:

  >>> browser.getControl(name='msgset_137_af_translation_0_new_checkbox').value = True
  >>> browser.getControl(name='msgset_137_af_translation_0_new').value = 'evolution minikaart'
  >>> browser.getControl(name='submit_translations').click()
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/9/+translate'

And finally, let's take a look again, and we should have a translation added.

  >>> browser.getLink('Previous').click()
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/8/+translate'
  >>> '(no translation yet)' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> 'evolution minikaart' in browser.contents
  True
