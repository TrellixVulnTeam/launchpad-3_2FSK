        <h3>About Launchpad</h3>

        <p>Launchpad takes a new approach to free software project management
           and hosting. It helps you to work more effectively with other
           communities to solve common problems, such as shared bugs.</p>

        <p>Such conversations have traditionally been difficult between
           communities using different tools. Launchpad brings those
           communities closer together by linking information from
           project-specific sources and presenting it through a common
           interface.</p>

        <p>Launchpad also helps you to build your project's community.
           Spontaneous team formation allows rich community structures to
           develop quickly and lowers the barriers for new participants.</p>

        <p>Created for Ubuntu, and now also used by Zope, Creative Commons
          and Silva CMS, Launchpad is secure, reliable and managed by a
          dedicated team of experienced developers and administrators. It
          takes just a few minutes to add your project and there's free
          migration support for open source projects.</p>
