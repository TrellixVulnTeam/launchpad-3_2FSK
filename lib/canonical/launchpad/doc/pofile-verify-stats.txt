= POFile statistics =

We frequently display statistics about POFiles: how many of its messages
remain untranslated, how many have been changed in Launchpad, how many have
had suggested translations submitted that need to be reviewed?

It takes too long to gather these statistics on demand, so we cache them in
POFile fields.  When translations are changed, these statistics can be either
updated incrementally or recomputed altogether.

Incremental updates carry a risk of errors creeping in and being preserved
even during some updates.  That's why a cron job trawls the POFile table,
recomputing translation statistics and noting any divergence between the
cached values and the ones it recomputes from scratch.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.verify_pofile_stats import (
    ...     VerifyPOFileStatsProcess)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> verifier = VerifyPOFileStatsProcess(transaction, logger, 30)
    >>> verifier.run()
    INFO Starting verification of POFile stats at id 30
    INFO Done.

If for any reason any POFiles' statistics are found to be wrong, the
differences will be reported.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.pofile import POFile
    >>> pofile = POFile.get(34)
    >>> pofile.getStatistics()
    (0, 0, 3, 0)
    >>> pofile.rosettacount = 999
    >>> verifier = VerifyPOFileStatsProcess(transaction, logger, 34)
    >>> verifier.run()
    INFO Starting verification of POFile stats at id 34
    WARNING POFile 34:
    cached stats were (0, 0, 999, 0), recomputed as (0, 0, 3, 0)
    INFO Done.
