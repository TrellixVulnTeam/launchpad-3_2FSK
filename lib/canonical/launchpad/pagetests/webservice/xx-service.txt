= Introduction =

Some standard behavior is defined by the web service itself, not by
the individual resources.


== Authorization ==

  # XXX leonardr 2008-05-22 spec=api-bugs-remote:
  # Once we launch the web service this test will be removed
  # because all users will have access to the web service.

In a development environment, any Launchpad person with an OAuth token
can make a request of the web service. Here's the 'no-priv' user
making a request.

  >>> print user_webservice.get("/~launchpad").getOutput()
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

But in production, only Launchpad people who belong to a particular
team of beta testers are allowed to make requests. This code
configures that team so that web service clients must be authorized as
a member of the 'admins' team.

  >>> from canonical.config import config
  >>> print config.vhost.api.beta_test_team
  None

  >>> from textwrap import dedent
  >>> test_data = dedent("""
  ...     [vhost.api]
  ...     beta_test_team: admins
  ...     """)
  >>> config.push('test', test_data)

Now 'no-priv' can no longer make web service requests.

  >>> print user_webservice.get("/~launchpad").getOutput()
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  ...
  no-priv is not a member of the beta test team.
  ...

But 'salgado' belongs to the 'admins' team, and so can make web
service requests.

  >>> print webservice.get("/~launchpad").getOutput()
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

If for some reason the variable's value is set to a nonsensical value,
access to the web service will be cut off altogether.

  >>> test_config = config.pop('test')
  >>> from textwrap import dedent
  >>> test_data = dedent("""
  ...     [vhost.api]
  ...     beta_test_team: nosuchteam
  ...     """)
  >>> config.push('test', test_data)

  >>> print webservice.get("/~launchpad").getOutput()
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  ...
  salgado is not a member of the beta test team.
  ...

  >>> test_config = config.pop('test')


== Resources not exposed on the web service ==

Soyuz build set (exposed on the web at builders) are not available on the
web service:

    >>> print webservice.get("/builders")
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...


== API Requests to other hosts ==

JavaScript working with the API must deal with the browser's Same Origin
Policy - requests may only be made to the host that the page was loaded
from.  For example, we can not visit a page on http://bugs.launchpad.net
and make a request to http://api.launchpad.net.

Instead of directing the request to api.launchpad.net, we may direct it
at the /api subpath of the current virtual host, such as
http://bugs.launchpad.net/api.  Such requests are handled as if they
were directed at the api.launchpad.net subdomain.

The URLs in the returned representations point to the current host,
rather than the api host.  The canonical_url() function also returns
links to the current host.

The ServiceRoot for http://bugs.launchpad.dev/api/beta/ is the same as a
request to http://api.launchpad.net/beta/, but with the links pointing
to a different host.

    >>> root = webservice.get(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/api/beta/').jsonBody()
    >>> print root['people_collection_link']
    http://bugs.launchpad.dev/api/beta/people

Requests on these hosts also honor the standard Launchpad authorization
scheme (and don't require OAuth).

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import (
    ...     LaunchpadWebServiceCaller)
    >>> noauth_webservice = LaunchpadWebServiceCaller()
    >>> sample_auth = 'Basic %s' % 'test@canonical.com:test'.encode('base64')
    >>> print noauth_webservice.get(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/api/beta/people/+me',
    ...     headers={'Authorization': sample_auth})
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://bugs.launchpad.dev/api/beta/~name12...
    ...

But the regular authentication still doesn't work on the normal API
virtual host:

    >>> print noauth_webservice.get(
    ...     'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/people/+me',
    ...     headers={'Authorization': sample_auth})
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    ...
