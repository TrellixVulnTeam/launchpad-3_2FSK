This directory contains integration tests for proper interaction between
Launchpad and Mailman.  These are /not/ unit tests that can be run inside of
either application though, so this directory is not a Python package.

In order to perform these integration tests, you must build Launchpad, enable
the build of Mailman in your launchpad.conf, and run 'make mailman_instance'.
Then you must start Launchpad with 'make run_all' and at that point you can
manually run the scripts in this directory from the command line.
