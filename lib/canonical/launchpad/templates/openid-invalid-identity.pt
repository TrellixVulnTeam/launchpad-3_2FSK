        <p>
            A site identifying as
            <strong tal:content="view/openid_request/trust_root" />
            has asked us for confirmation that
            <strong tal:content="view/openid_request/identity" />
            is your identity URL. However, that is not a valid Launchpad
            OpenID identity URL, such as <strong
                tal:content="string:${vhosts/mainsite/rooturl}/~${view/login}"
                />
        </p>

            <input type="submit" value="Continue" />
