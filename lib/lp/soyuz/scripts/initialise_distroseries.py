    Preconditions:
      The distroseries must exist, and be completly unused, with no source
      or binary packages existing, as well as no distroarchseries set up.
      Section and component selections must be empty.

    Outcome:
      The distroarchseries set up in the parent series will be copied.
      The publishing structure will be copied from the parent. All
      PUBLISHED and PENDING packages in the parent will be created in
      this distroseries and its distroarchseriess. The lucille config
      will be copied in, all component and section selections will be
      duplicated as will any permission-related structures.

      This method will raise a InitialisationError when the pre-conditions
      are not met. After this is run, you still need to construct chroots

      order to assist you in preparing a new series of a distribution or
      in the initialisation of a derivative.
