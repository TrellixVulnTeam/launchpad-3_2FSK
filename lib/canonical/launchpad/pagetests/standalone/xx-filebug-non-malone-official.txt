If you try to file a bug on a product which doesn't use Malone as its
bug tracker, you will be told so.

  >>> user_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/alsa-utils/+filebug")
  >>> print user_browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...alsa-utils...does not use Malone as its bug tracker.
  ...
  ...To report a bug about alsa-utils,...
  ...

The same if you try to file a bug on a distribution which doesn't use
Malone.

  >>> user_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/debian/+filebug")
  >>> print user_browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...Debian...
  ...does not use Malone as its bug tracker.
  ...
  ...To report a bug about Debian...
  ...please use its official bug tracker.
  ...

It's also not possible to file a bug on any of the distribution's
source package.

  >>> user_browser.open(
  ...     "http://launchpad.dev/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/"
  ...     "+filebug")
  >>> print user_browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  Debian...does not use Malone as its bug tracker.
  ...
  ...To report a bug about Debian...
  ...please use its official bug tracker.
