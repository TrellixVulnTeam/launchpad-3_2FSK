 = Launchpad's WADL documents =

Every resource in the web service has a WADL representation that
describes the capabilities of the resource in a machine-readable
format. These documents are similar to the HTML documents that provide
human beings with links to click and forms to fill out.


== Entry resources ==

Let's get a WADL representation of a resource (in this case, a
person), and see what's inside.

    >>> wadl = webservice.get(
    ...     '/beta/~salgado', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml').getBody()

It's an XML document.

    >>> print wadl
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <application xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns="http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10/wadl.xsd">
    ...
    </application>

Let's parse it.

    >>> import cElementTree as ET
    >>> tree = ET.fromstring(wadl)

The root tag of any WADL document is called 'application'. Note the
namespaced tag name; this test will be ignoring the namespace from
this point on.

    >>> tree.tag
    '{http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10}application'

The <application> tag for a WADL representation of an entry contains a
single <resources> tag.

    >>> resources, = list(tree)
    >>> resources.tag
    '...resources'

The <resources> tag describes a set of resources rooted at the
person's URL.

    >>> resources.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado'

The <resources> tag contains a single <resource> tag. The WADL
description of a person describes only one resource: the person
itself.

    >>> resource, = list(resources)
    >>> resource.tag
    '...resource'
    >>> resource.attrib['path']
    ''

What are the capabilities of this resource?

    >>> resource.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#PersonEntry'

Since all person resources work the same way, the capabilities of any
particular person resource are described by reference to a separate
WADL document. This document is located at the service root (/beta/),
and the part of the document that describes a person resource has the
XML id "PersonEntry". We'll look at this document later.

To summarize: the WADL representation of an entry is a very short XML
document that says "The resource at this URL is of type [foo]," where
[foo] is a reference to another WADL document.


== Collection resources ==

The WADL description of a collection looks a lot like the WADL
description of an entry. It's an <application> tag that contains a
<resources> tag that contains a <resource> tag.

    >>> wadl = webservice.get('/beta/people',
    ...                       'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml').getBody()
    >>> tree = ET.fromstring(wadl)
    >>> tree.tag
    '...application'

    >>> resources, = list(tree)
    >>> resources.tag
    '...resources'
    >>> resources.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/people'

The <resource> tag defines the capabilities of the collection resource
by referencing another WADL document.

    >>> resource, = resources
    >>> resource.tag
    '...resource'
    >>> resource.attrib['path']
    ''
    >>> resource.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#PersonSetCollectionAdapter'


== Scoped collection resources ==

The WADL representation of a scoped collection is pretty similar to
the representation of a non-scoped collection. The difference is that
all scoped collections are of the same type: "ScopedCollection".

    >>> wadl = webservice.get('/beta/~admins/members',
    ...                       'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml').getBody()

    >>> tree = ET.fromstring(wadl)
    >>> tree.tag
    '...application'

    >>> resources, = list(tree)
    >>> resources.tag
    '...resources'
    >>> resources.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~admins/members'

    >>> resource, = resources
    >>> resource.attrib['path']
    ''
    >>> resource.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#ScopedCollection'


== The service root ==

All the WADL documents we've seen so far have been very simple,
describing a single resource and describing it by reference to another
WADL document. That other document is the WADL representation of the
service root. It describes the capabilities of every kind of resource
the service offers. It also describes the JSON representations those
resources serve, and any custom methods invokable on those
resources. It's a big document.

    >>> wadl = webservice.get(
    ...     '/beta/', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml').getBody()
    >>> tree = ET.fromstring(wadl)

Like all WADL documents, the WADL representation of the service root
is rooted at an <application> tag.

    >>> tree.tag
    '...application'

As with the WADL descriptions of collection and entry resources, this
<application> tag describes the capabilities of the server root
resource. But that <application> tag also contains all the information
referenced by all the other WADL documents in the system. #PersonEntry
is here, as is #PersonSetCollectionAdapter and #ScopedCollection and
many other targets of a <resource> tag's 'type' attribute. Also
located here are the descriptions of the JSON representations those
resources serve.


== Description of the service root itself ==

Let's whittle down the complexity a little by taking a look at the
description of the service root resource itself.

    >>> children = list(tree)
    >>> service_root_type, service_root_repr, resources = children[:3]
    >>> # We'll deal with the rest of the children later.
    >>> other_children = children[3:]

The service root is an instance of a special resource type that
responds only to GET.

    >>> service_root_type.tag
    '...resource_type'
    >>> service_root_type.attrib['id']
    'service-root'
    >>> (doc, get) = list(service_root_type)
    >>> get.tag
    '...method'
    >>> get.attrib['name']
    'GET'

A client that makes a GET request to a resource of this type can get a
representation of type 'service-root-json', or it can get a WADL
representation. The WADL representation is the document we're looking
at right now.

    >>> response, = list(get)
    >>> json_repr, wadl_repr, = list(response)
    >>> json_repr.attrib['href']
    '#service-root-json'
    >>> wadl_repr.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml'

The details of the 'service-root-json' representation are given
immediately afterwards:

    >>> service_root_repr.tag
    '...representation'
    >>> service_root_repr.attrib['id']
    'service-root-json'
    >>> service_root_repr.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/json'

The JSON representation contains a link for each collection resource
exposed at the top level. The WADL representation has a <param> tag
for every link in the JSON representation.

    >>> person_set_param = [
    ...     param for param in service_root_repr
    ...     if param.attrib['name'].startswith('PersonSet')][0]
    >>> person_set_param.tag
    '...param'
    >>> person_set_param.attrib['path']
    "$['PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link']"
    >>> person_set_param.attrib['name']
    'PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link'

This is saying that applying the JSONPath expression
'$['PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link']' to the JSON document
will give you something interesting: a variable we like to call
'PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link'.

What's special about this variable? Well, it's a link to another
resource. This is represented in WADL by giving the <param> tag a
child <link> tag. The <link> tag explains what sort of resource is at
the other end of the link.

    >>> person_set_param_link, = list(person_set_param)
    >>> person_set_param_link.tag
    '...link'
    >>> person_set_param_link.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#PersonSetCollectionAdapter'

A WADL client can read this and know that if it ever finds a resource
of type "service-root", it can send a GET request to that URL and get
back a JSON document. By applying the JSON expression
'["PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link"]' to that document, it
will find the URL to the list of people. The list of people has the
characteristics described (in WADL format) at
http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#PersonSetCollectionAdapter.

But where is the WADL client going to find a resource of type
"service-root" in the first place? The <resources> tag will explain
everything.

    >>> resources.tag
    '...resources'
    >>> resources.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/'

As with the <resources> tags shown earlier, this one contains a single
<resource> tag.

    >>> resource, = resources
    >>> resource.tag
    '...resource'
    >>> resource.attrib['path']
    ''
    >>> resource.attrib['type']
    '#service-root'

Aha! There's a resource of type "service-root" right there at the
service root! Who would have thought?


== The rest of the document ==

Looking at the children of the <application> tag can be
overwhelming. The description of the service root resource is
relatively simple, but then there are a huge number of
<representation> and <resource_type> tags that don't have anything to
do directly with the service root: they form a description of the web
service as a whole. I'll explain the large-scale structure of the
document and then show some examples in detail.

The first few tags are <resource_type> tags which describe the
different possible kinds of collections: person collections, bug
collections, and so on. Then there's a <representation> tag which
describes the JSON document you get if you send GET to a collection.
This code stores the <representation> tag in 'collection_rep' and the
initial <resource_type> tags in 'collection_resource_types'.

    >>> for index, child in enumerate(other_children):
    ...     if child.tag.endswith('representation'):
    ...         last_collection_tag = index
    ...         break

    >>> collection_resource_types = other_children[:last_collection_tag]
    >>> collection_rep = other_children[last_collection_tag]

After that <representation> tag there's a group of three tags for
every type of entry resource exposed through the web service. The
first tag in a group is a <resource_type> tag that describes the
capabilities of that resource. The second is a <representation> tag
that describes the document sent to the client in response to GET
requests, and expected from the client along with a PUT request. The
third is a <representation> tag that describes the document sent to
the client in response to PATCH requests. This code splits the tags
into groups of three and stores the groups in
'entry_resource_descriptions'.

    >>> entry_resource_types = other_children[last_collection_tag+1:]
    >>> entry_resource_descriptions = []
    >>> for index in range(0, len(entry_resource_types), 3):
    ...     resource_type = entry_resource_types[index]
    ...     full_repr = entry_resource_types[index+1]
    ...     diff_repr = entry_resource_types[index+2]
    ...     entry_resource_descriptions.append(
    ...         (resource_type, full_repr, diff_repr))


== An entry resource type ==

First let's look at how the service root WADL describes entry
resources.

    >>> sorted([entry[0].attrib['id']
    ...         for entry in entry_resource_descriptions])
    ['BugEntry', 'BugTaskEntry', ... 'TeamMembershipEntry']

There's one <resource_type> tag for every kind of entry on the
site. Let's take a close look at the WADL description of a bug task.

    >>> bugtask_description = [entry for entry in entry_resource_descriptions
    ...                    if entry[0].attrib['id'] == 'BugTaskEntry'][0]

    >>> (resource_type, full_rep, diff_rep) = bugtask_description


=== Representations ===

The definition of a bug task is contained in a <resource_type> tag and
two <representation> tags. First lets look at the two
representations. Each <representation> tag specifies what media type
it's describing. Both of these <representation> tags describe JSON
documents.

    >>> full_rep.tag
    '...representation'
    >>> full_rep.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/json'
    >>> full_rep.attrib['id']
    'BugTaskEntry-full'

    >>> diff_rep.tag
    '...representation'
    >>> diff_rep.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/json'
    >>> diff_rep.attrib['id']
    'BugTaskEntry-diff'


=== Parameters ===

Inside the <representation> tag there may be <parameter> tags that
point clients to interesting parts of the representation. Our JSON
representations of entries are hashes, and we've chosen to specify a
parameter for each key of the hash.

    >>> full_params = list(full_rep)
    >>> full_params[0].tag
    '...param'
    >>> full_rep_names = sorted([param.attrib['name']
    ...                         for param in full_params])
    >>> full_rep_names
    ['assignee_link', 'bug_link', ... 'title']

In addition to a name, each parameter has a 'path', a JSONPath
expression you can apply to the JSON data structure to get the
parameter's value.

    >>> sorted([param.attrib['path'] for param in full_params])
    ["$['assignee_link']", "$['bug_link']", ... "$['title']"]

So to get the assignee link out of a JSON data structure you need to
look up the element called "assignee_link".

A parameter may also have human-readable documentation: an optional
name for the parameter and an optional short description.

    >>> doc = full_params[0][0]
    >>> doc.tag
    '...doc'
    >>> doc.text
    '<strong>Status</strong>'

Some parameters are links to other resources. These parameters have a
child tag called 'link' with information about what's on the other end
of the link.

    >>> assignee_param, = [param for param in full_params
    ...                    if param.attrib['name'] == 'assignee_link']
    >>> assignee_link, = list(assignee_param)
    >>> assignee_link.tag
    '...link'

The link's 'type' attribute tells the client about the capabilities of
the resource at the other end of the link.

    >>> assignee_link.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#PersonEntry'

If the link is a link to collection, the 'type' will always be
'ScopedCollection' (at least for now).

    >>> related_tasks, = [
    ...     param for param in full_params
    ...     if param.attrib['name'] == 'related_tasks_collection_link']
    >>> (doc, related_tasks_link) = related_tasks.getchildren()
    >>> related_tasks_link.tag
    '...link'
    >>> related_tasks_link.attrib['type']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#ScopedCollection'

The full representation contains all fields, even read-only ones,
because it's describing the document you receive when you make a GET
request. You can modify such a document and send it back with PUT, so
the full representation also suffices to describe the documents you
PUT. But you can't send values for read-only fields with PATCH, so we
define a second representation for use with PATCH requests.

    >>> diff_params = list(diff_rep)
    >>> diff_params[0].tag
    '...param'
    >>> diff_rep_names = sorted([param.attrib['name']
    ...                          for param in diff_params])

    >>> 'related_tasks_collection_link' in full_rep_names
    True
    >>> 'related_tasks_collection_link' in diff_rep_names
    False

Most 'param' tags don't tell the client much beyond where to find a
certain parameter, but some of our parameters take values from a
proscribed vocabulary. These parameters correspond to Choice fields
who take their vocabulary from an EnumeratedValue. For these
parameters, we provide the client with information about the possible
values.

    >>> status_param, = [param for param in full_params
    ...                   if param.attrib['name'] == 'status']
    >>> status_options = status_param.getchildren()
    >>> status_options[0].tag
    '...doc'
    >>> status_options[1].tag
    '...option'
    >>> sorted(status.attrib['value'] for status in status_options[1:])
    ['Confirmed', 'Fix Committed', ... "Won't Fix"]


=== The resource type itself ===

The 'representation' tags tell you what representations a resource
sends and receives. In this case the representations are for a
'bugtask' resource. What about the resource itself? All bug tasks are
pretty much the same, and so most of the information about a bug task
is kept in the <resource_type> tag.

    >>> resource_type.tag
    '...resource_type'

    >>> doc_and_methods = list(resource_type)
    >>> doc = doc_and_methods[0]
    >>> methods = doc_and_methods[1:]
    >>> get, put, patch, post = methods

A resource type may have some human-readable documentation:

    >>> doc.text
    'A bugtask.\n'

A resource type tells the client about the three standard operations
on a resource (GET, PUT, and PATCH), as well as any custom GET or POST
operations.


The name of a method is always the HTTP method used to activate
it. Different operations that use the same method are distinguished by
XML id. Here that's not a problem; we have one custom POST method
('BugTaskEntry-change_status'), plus the standard GET, PATCH, and PUT.

    >>> [method.attrib['name'] for method in methods]
    ['GET', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'POST']

    >>> [method.attrib['id'] for method in methods]
    ['BugTaskEntry-get', 'BugTaskEntry-put',
     'BugTaskEntry-patch', 'BugTaskEntry-change_status']


=== Standard entry operations ===

The standard GET operation defines a 'response' tag, which tells the
client that they can use content negotiation to get two different
representations of a bug task: the JSON one described above as
"BugTask-full", and a WADL document--the sort of document shown in the
very first section of this test.

    >>> response, = list(get)
    >>> response.tag
    '...response'
    >>> full, wadl = list(response)
    >>> full.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#BugTaskEntry-full'

    >>> wadl.attrib['id']
    'BugTaskEntry-wadl'
    >>> wadl.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml'

Note that the JSON representation is just a hyperlink to the
representation defined earlier.

Similarly, the standard PUT and PATCH methods each include a 'request'
tag, which tells the client which representation it should send along
with a request.

    >>> request, = list(put)
    >>> request.tag
    '...request'
    >>> representation, = list(request)
    >>> representation.attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#BugTaskEntry-full'

    >>> patch[0][0].attrib['href']
    'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/#BugTaskEntry-diff'

This is why we defined the representations separately. Now we can
link to them instead of describing them every time.


=== Custom operations ===

Custom operations may have human-readable documentation.

    >>> post[0].tag
    '...doc'
    >>> post[0].text
    "<p>An operation that modifies a bug task's status.</p>..."

Custom operations define parameters, just like representations do.

    >>> post_params = list(post[1:])
    >>> [param.attrib['name'] for param in post_params]
    ['ws_op', 'status']

The 'ws_op' parameter is present for all custom operations. It's always
required, and fixed to a particular value.

    >>> ws_op, status = post_params
    >>> ws_op.attrib['required']
    'True'
    >>> ws_op.attrib['fixed']
    'change_status'

Depending on the operation there might be other parameters. If the
parameters of the right type, they too can be described with a list of
valid values.

    >>> sorted([value.attrib['value'] for value in list(status)])
    ['Confirmed', 'Fix Committed', ... "Won't Fix"]


== The collection representation ==

The representation of one type of entry (say, a person) looks
different from the representation of another type (say, a bug), but
all collections look the same, no matter what kind of entries they
contain. That's why there's only one <representation> tag shared
between all collection resource types.

    >>> collection_rep.tag
    '...representation'
    >>> collection_rep.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/json'
    >>> collection_rep.attrib['id']
    'collection-page'
    >>> params = list(collection_rep)
    >>> [param.attrib['name'] for param in params]
    ['total_size', 'next_collection_link', 'prev_collection_link', 'entries']
    >>> size, next, prev, entries = params

The 'next_collection_link' and 'prev_collection_link' parameters are
links to other resources. What are these other resources? Other pages
of the same collection!

    >>> next_type, = list(next)
    >>> next_type.attrib['type']
    '#collection-page'

    >>> prev_type, = list(prev)
    >>> prev_type.attrib['type']
    '#collection-page'


== A collection resource type ==

Let's look at the different collection resource types defined in the
WADL file.

    >>> sorted([type.attrib['id'] for type in collection_resource_types])
    ['BugCollection', ... 'ScopedCollection']

There's one <resource_type> tag for scoped collections, and another
tag for every specific kind of collection on the site. We'll be taking
a close look at the resource type for the collection of people on the
site.

    >>> resource_type = [
    ...     type for type in collection_resource_types
    ...     if type.attrib['id'] == 'PersonSetCollectionAdapter'][0]
    >>> resource_type.tag
    '...resource_type'


=== The resource type itself ===

Any collection resource supports one standard HTTP method (GET) in
addition to any custom operations.  This particular type of resource
exposes two custom operations, 'create_person' (POST) and 'people'
(GET).

    >>> methods = list(resource_type)

    >>> [method.attrib['name'] for method in methods]
    ['GET', 'POST', 'GET']

    >>> [method.attrib['id'] for method in methods]
    ['PersonSetCollectionAdapter-get',
     'PersonSetCollectionAdapter-create_person',
     'PersonSetCollectionAdapter-people']

    >>> (get, create_person, people) = methods

The standard GET operation is a way of getting either the
'collection-page' representation defined above, or else a short WADL
description of a particular collection, like the one shown earlier.

    >>> response, = list(get)
    >>> json_rep, wadl_rep = list(response)
    >>> json_rep.attrib['href']
    '#collection-page'

    >>> wadl_rep.attrib['mediaType']
    'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml'
    >>> wadl_rep.attrib['id']
    'PersonSetCollectionAdapter-wadl'

The 'create_person' custom operation takes a number of parameters.

    >>> [param.attrib['name'] for param in list(create_person)]
    ['ws_op', 'email_address', 'comment', 'name', 'display_name', 'password']

    >>> ws_op = create_person[0]
    >>> ws_op.attrib['fixed']
    'create_person'

So does the 'people' custom operation.

    >>> [param.attrib['name'] for param in list(people)]
    ['ws_op', 'text']

    >>> ws_op = people[0]
    >>> ws_op.attrib['fixed']
    'people'


== The scoped collection resource type ==

As mentioned earlier, all scoped collections have the same resource
type: "ScopedCollection". The only difference between ScopedCollection
and any other collection resource type is that, right now, scoped
collections never have custom operations. They only support the
standard GET operation.

    >>> resource_type = [
    ...     type for type in collection_resource_types
    ...     if type.attrib['id'] == 'ScopedCollection'][0]
    >>> (doc, get) = resource_type
    >>> get.attrib['id']
    'ScopedCollection-get'
