Launchpad's front page

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/'

should include buttons for the main applications

  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...Register your project...
  ...Publish your code...
  ...

a search form

  >>> '<input type="submit" value="Search"' in browser.contents
  True

and lists of featured projects and marketing material.

  >>> 'Featured projects' in browser.contents
  True
  
  'More about Launchpad' in browser.contents
  True

We would like to test various features of the home page. This will prevent
accidental regressions in the layout of the home page.

First, we should be seeing a translation box for Ubuntu Hoary into
Afrikaans:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1

  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Afrikaans:...
  .../ubuntu/hoary/+lang/af...

home page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Sample Person...
