BranchView is the general class for displaying Branches.

>>> from zope.component import getView
>>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
>>> branchset = getUtility(IBranchSet)
>>> gterm = branchset[15]
>>> pushed = branchset[25]
>>> gterm_view = getView(gterm, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> pushed_view = getView(pushed, '+index', TestRequest())

Each branch is associated to an URL on the Supermirror, that includes the name
of the owner and product of the branch.

>>> gterm_view.supermirror_url()
u'http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~name12/gnome-terminal/main'

A Branch has a display name that is the Branch.title if it's provided, or a
unique name based on the Supermirror URL for that branch.

>>> gterm_view.display_name()
u'GNOME Terminal Mainline'
>>> assert pushed_view.context.title is None
>>> pushed_view.display_name()
u'~name12/gnome-terminal/pushed'
