Check the behaviour of the initialise_from_parent script. It basically
calls IDistroRelease.initialiseFromParent method with experimental extra
checks and tasks.

We need to create an initialisable DistroRelease as a child of Ubuntu
Hoary (we do it inside the ubuntutest distribution to avoid conflicts
with other tests)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login

  >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
  >>> distribution_set = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
  >>> ubuntutest = distribution_set['ubuntutest']
  >>> ubuntu = distribution_set['ubuntu']
  >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']

  XXX cprov 20060529: new distrorelease should be provided by IDistribution
  This maybe affected by derivation design and is documented in bug
  #49133

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroReleaseSet
  >>> distrorelease_set = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)
  >>> foobuntu = distrorelease_set.new(ubuntutest, 'foobuntu', 'FooBuntu',
  ...                                  'The Foobuntu', 'yeck', 'doom',
  ...                                  '888', hoary, hoary.owner)

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()


  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import os
  >>> import sys
  >>> from canonical.config import config


Check if it fails for an already released distrorelease:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vv",
  ...                             "breezy-autotest"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  1
  >>> print stderr

  Traceback (most recent call last):

  <BLANKLINE>


Let's initialise the just create distrorelease:

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools",
  ...                       "initialise-from-parent.py")
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vv",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest", "foobuntu"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stderr
  DEBUG   Acquiring lock
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.

  <BLANKLINE>


Checking the published sources and binaries of ubuntutest/foobuntu
against its parent, ubuntu/hoary:

  >>> hoary_pmount_pubs = hoary.getPublishedReleases('pmount')
  >>> foobuntu_pmount_pubs = foobuntu.getPublishedReleases('pmount')
  >>> len(foobuntu_pmount_pubs) == len(hoary_pmount_pubs)
  True

  >>> hoary_i386_pmount_pubs = hoary['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount')
  >>> foobuntu_i386_pmount_pubs = (
  ...     foobuntu['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount'))
  >>> len(foobuntu_i386_pmount_pubs) == len(hoary_i386_pmount_pubs)
  True


Check how the publication records behave in a just-initialise distrorelease.
First we get a binarypackagerelease published in foobuntu:

  >>> pmount_binrel = (
  ...     foobuntu['i386'].getReleasedPackages(
  ...     'pmount')[0].binarypackagerelease)
  >>> pmount_binrel.title
  u'pmount-0.1-1'

Follow BPR.build and discover it was built in the parent release:

  >>> pmount_binrel.build.id
  7
  >>> pmount_binrel.build.title
  u'i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu hoary RELEASE'

Now we obtain the sourcepackagerelease from the build:

  >>> pmount_srcrel = pmount_binrel.build.sourcepackagerelease
  >>> pmount_srcrel.title
  u'pmount - 0.1-1'

and check it the ISPR.getBuildByArch() would find out the same build
record for foobuntu and it's parent release (hoary):

  >>> pmount_srcrel.getBuildByArch(foobuntu['i386']).id == pmount_srcrel.getBuildByArch(hoary['i386']).id
  True

It means that queuebuilder doesn't need to create a new build record
in for pmount_0.1-1 in foobuntu.

In the other hand there is a newer source for pmount published in
hoary and consequently in foobuntu:

XXX cprov 20060911: this is a very unlikely situation, since
ubuntu/hoary was marked as RELEASED before build pmount_0.1-2
in the sampledata. So when we try initialise a distrorelease in
another distribution based on hoary, since they have independent
archives (pool), pmount_0.1-1 binary becomes a NBS (not build from
source) since the pmount_0.1-1 source was superseded in hoary and
won't be inherited by the initialised distrorelease.

  >>> pmount_source = hoary.getSourcePackage('pmount').currentrelease
  >>> pmount_source.title
  u'pmount 0.1-2 (source) in ubuntu hoary'

  >>> pmount_source = foobuntu.getSourcePackage('pmount').currentrelease
  >>> pmount_source.title
  u'pmount 0.1-2 (source) in ubuntutest foobuntu'


Since pmount_0.1-2 source is published we can safely look up for the
respective build record:

  >>> pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['i386']) is None
  True

It's not present, Let's create it to check if getBuildByArch responds
appropriately (we won't care about the source architecturehintlist in
this test, see more details in buildd-queuebuilder)

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import PackagePublishingPocket
  >>> created_build = pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
  ...    foobuntu['i386'], pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)

  >>> retrieved_build = pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['i386'])

  >>> retrieved_build.id == created_build.id
  True

  >>> pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['hppa']) is None
  True
