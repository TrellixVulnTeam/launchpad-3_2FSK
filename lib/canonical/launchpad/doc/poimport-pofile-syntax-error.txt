= PO Import test with a .po file that has a syntax error =

When we import a .po file with a syntax error, we should notify
the user about that error so they have a chance to fix it.

In this test, we are going to check that we detect and notify the error.

Here are some imports we need to get this test running.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationImportQueue
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplateSubset
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
    >>> translation_import_queue = getUtility(ITranslationImportQueue)

We need this for the Librarian to work properly.

    >>> import transaction

And also, the DBSchema to change the imports status

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import RosettaImportStatus

Login as an admin to be able to do changes to the import queue.

    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')

Here's the person who'll be doing the import.

    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> person = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')

Now, is time to create the new potemplate

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ProductRelease
    >>> release = ProductRelease.get(3)
    >>> release.productseries.product.name
    u'firefox'
    >>> series = release.productseries
    >>> subset = POTemplateSubset(productseries=series)
    >>> potemplate = subset.new(
    ...     name='firefox',
    ...     translation_domain='firefox',
    ...     path='po/firefox.pot',
    ...     owner=person)

We create the POFile object where we are going to attach the .po file.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('cy')

Let's import a .po file that misses the '"' char after msgstr.
That's a syntax error.

    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-03 20:41+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=n==1) "
    ...     "? 0 : n==2 ? 1 : (n != 8 || n != 11) ? 2 : 3;\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr blah"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    >>> published = False
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, published, person,
    ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()

We must approve the entry to be able to import it.

    >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED

We do the import.

    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)

The status is now FAILED:

    >>> print entry.status.name
    FAILED

And the code composed an email with the notification of the error.

    >>> subject
    u'Import problem - Welsh (cy) - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
    >>> print message
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,

== Invalid numbers of plural forms ==

Some uploads declare impossible numbers of plural forms.  Those uploads
are rejected.


=== Non-numeric plural forms ===

In his rush to be the first Sumerian translator for Firefox, Mark
submits a translation with a nonsensical plurals definition.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('sux')
    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-29 11:44+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=n; plural=0\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "bar"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, False, person,
    ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED
    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)


The submission is rejected with a syntax error.

    >>> print entry.status.name
    FAILED

    >>> subject
    u'Import problem - Sumerian (sux) - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
    >>> print message

    <BLANKLINE>
    ...


=== Not enough forms ===

Mark mistakenly attempts to import a translation with "zero" plural
forms.  He receives an email notifying him of a syntax error.

    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-14 18:33+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=0; plural=0\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "bar"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, False, person,
    ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED
    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)

    >>> print entry.status.name
    FAILED

    >>> subject
    u'Import problem - Sumerian (sux) - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
    >>> print message
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    We were unable to import the file because of errors in its format.
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...


On his next attempt, Mark accidentally types a negative number of plural
forms.  The same error is given.

    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-15 19:04+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=-1; plural=0\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "bar"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, False, person,
    ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED
    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)

    >>> print entry.status.name
    FAILED

    >>> subject
    u'Import problem - Sumerian (sux) - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
    >>> print message
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    ...
    We were unable to import the file because of errors in its format.
    ...


== Too many plural forms ==

Next Mark, eclectic polyglot that he is, uploads an Arabic translation
defining six plural forms.  Unfortunately only up to 4 forms are
supported in Launchpad.  He receives a message about this.

Since it's painful to find out that Launchpad doesn't support your
language, the email points to Launchpad's information about Arabic and
shows how to get that information corrected if need be.  Hopefully it
will show Mark how other Arabic translators have worked around the
problem.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('ar')
    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-07-01 08:35+0100\n"
