Product's Development Focus
===========================

Development focus for a product is often used to refer to two different
things.  Firstly there is the development focus series, and secondly there is
the development focus branch.  Each product series can be linked to a specific
Bazaar branch.

The development focus information is shown as part of the project information
section on the product overview page.

    >>> from lp.testing import login, logout
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> eric = factory.makePerson(
    ...     name='eric', email='eric@example.com', password='test')
    >>> fooix = factory.makeProduct(
    ...     name='fooix', owner=eric)
    >>> branch = factory.makeBranch(owner=eric, product=fooix, name='trunk')
    >>> logout()

    >>> owner_browser = setupBrowser('Basic eric@example.com:test')
    >>> def print_development_focus(browser):
    ...     """Print out the development focus part of the project info."""
    ...     project_info = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'project-info')
    ...     dev_focus = project_info.find(attrs={'id':'dev-focus'})
    ...     print extract_text(dev_focus)
    ...     print "Links:"
    ...     for a in dev_focus.findAll('a'):
    ...         for content in a.contents:
    ...             print content
    ...         title = a.get('title', '')
    ...         print "%s (%s)" % (title, a['href'])


Projects without development focus branches
-------------------------------------------

If the project has not specified a development focus branch then the
development focus section just contains a link to the development focus
series, and text telling the user that no branch has been specified.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/fooix')
    >>> print_development_focus(anon_browser)
    Development focus:
    trunk series
    Development focus branch has not been specified
    Links:
      trunk series (/fooix/trunk)

If the user has rights to change the development focus or to specify the
development focus branch, then these links are shown next to the text.

    >>> owner_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/fooix')
    >>> print_development_focus(owner_browser)
    Development focus:
    trunk series    Change details
    Development focus branch has not been specified  Link to branch
    Links:
      trunk series (/fooix/trunk)
      <span class="invisible-link">Change details</span>
        (http://launchpad.dev/fooix/+edit)
      <span class="invisible-link">Link to branch</span>
      Set the branch for this series
        (http://launchpad.dev/fooix/trunk/+linkbranch)

The owner can specify the development focus branch from the overview page.

    >>> owner_browser.getLink(url='+linkbranch').click()
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Branch').value = '~eric/fooix/trunk'
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Update').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(owner_browser.contents)
    Series code location updated.

The owner is taken back to the trunk series page.

    >>> print_tag_with_id(owner_browser.contents, 'branch-details')
    lp://dev/fooix - Eric  Change branch


Projects with development focus branches
----------------------------------------

If the project has a specified development focus branch, this is shown in the
development focus section of the project information.

There is a link both to the branch, and to the source code browser for that branch.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/fooix')
    >>> print_development_focus(anon_browser)
