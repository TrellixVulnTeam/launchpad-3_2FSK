Launchpad Celebrities
=====================

See https://wiki.launchpad.canonical.com/LaunchpadCelebrities

There are a number of special objects, some of which exist in the database,
which we want to give easy access to in the code.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)

  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> vcs_imports = personset.getByName('vcs-imports')
  >>> celebs.vcs_imports.__class__ == vcs_imports.__class__
  True
  >>> celebs.vcs_imports.id == vcs_imports.id
  True

The admins team will be renamed to the 'super' team in due course.  Meanwhile,
we need to have the admins team in ILaunchpadCelebrities.

  >>> admins = personset.getByName('admins')
  >>> celebs.admin.__class__ == admins.__class__
  True
  >>> celebs.admin.id == admins.id
  True

  TODO: add interface verification test.
        ask debonzi to add these in general.
