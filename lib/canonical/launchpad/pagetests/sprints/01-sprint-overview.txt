Launchpad Sprint Tracker
========================

Launchpad lets us register a meeting, and then keep track of which specs are
due to be discussed at that meeting. As a result we can schedule and
prioritise BOF's at the meeting, using an as-yet-undeveloped
schedul-o-matic.

Let's start by viewing the list of sprints registered.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /sprints HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Meetings and sprints...
  ...<a href=".../sprints/ubz">Ubuntu Below Zero</a>...

Now lets have a look at one sprint in particular. We expect to have UBZ in
the sample data:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /sprints/ubz HTTP/1.1

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
