The "coming soon" page is a view on the ISourcePackageSet (which really
should be a Subset, and really should disappear entirely...) which
is rendered when there is a request for a '+gethelp' or '+translate'
page of a sourcepackage, where that particular sourcepackage doesn't exist
in that distrorelease.

The pagetest for these pages is using hoary because breezy doesn't have
any sourcepackages in the sample data.

First, get the translation page for a package that does exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/pmount/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...pmount in ubuntu hoary...
  ...
  ...Help translate pmount in ubuntu hoary...
  ...

Get the gethelp page for a package that exists.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/pmount/+gethelp HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...pmount in ubuntu hoary...
  ...
  ...<h1>Help and support options</h1>...
  ...

Get the translation page for a package that does not exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The Hoary Hedgehog Release Source Packages...
  ...
  ...Coming soon...
  ...

Get the gethelp page for a package that does not exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+gethelp HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The Hoary Hedgehog Release Source Packages...
  ...
  ...Coming soon...
  ...

Get some other page for package that does not exist.  This shows that 404
errors still work, and that the 'coming soon' page is used only for
+gethelp and +translate pages.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+nosuchpagehere HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...
