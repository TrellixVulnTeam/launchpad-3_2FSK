= Answer Tracker Utility: IQuestionSet =

There is an IQuestionSet utility that can be use to retrieve and search
for question whatever the target they were created in.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IQuestionSet
    >>> question_set = getUtility(IQuestionSet)
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionSet, question_set)
    True


== get() ==

The get() method can be used to get a question with a specific id:

    >>> question_one = question_set.get(1)
    >>> question_one.title
    u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site'

If no question exists, a default value is returned:

    >>> default = object()
    >>> question_nonexistant = question_set.get(123456, default=default)
    >>> question_nonexistant is default
    True

If no default value is given, None is returned:

    >>> question_set.get(123456) is None
    True


== searchQuestions() ==

IQuestionSet also defines a searchQuestions() method that can be used to
search for questions defined in any products or distributions (in fact,
in any context that allows questions to be defined). Two search criteria
are defined search_text and status.


=== search_text ===

The search_text parameter will limit the questions to those matching
the query using the regular full text algorithm.

    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(search_text='firefox'):
    ...     print repr(question.title), question.target.displayname
    u'Problemas de Impress\xe3o no Firefox'        Mozilla Firefox
    u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'          Mozilla Firefox
    u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site'             Mozilla Firefox
    u'mailto: problem in webpage'                  mozilla-firefox in ubuntu
    u"Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used" Mozilla Firefox
    u'Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site'    Mozilla Firefox
    u'\u0639\u0643\u0633 ...'                      Ubuntu


=== status ===

By default, expired and invalid questions are not searched for. The
status parameter can be used to select the questions in the status
you are interested in.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import QuestionStatus
    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(
    ...     status=QuestionStatus.INVALID):
    ...     print question.title, question.status.title, (
    ...         question.target.displayname)
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM Invalid mozilla-firefox in ubuntu

The status parameter can also take a list of statuses.

    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(
    ...         status=[QuestionStatus.SOLVED, QuestionStatus.INVALID]):
    ...     print question.title, question.status.title, (
    ...          question.target.displayname)
    mailto: problem in webpage                Solved mozilla-firefox in ubuntu
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM Invalid mozilla-firefox in ubuntu


=== language ===

The language parameter can be used to select only questions written in a
particular language.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> spanish = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['es']
    >>> for t in question_set.searchQuestions(language=spanish):
    ...     print t.title.encode('us-ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp (doble-n\xfacleo)

=== Combination ===

The returned sets of questions is the intersection of the sets delimited
by each criteria:

    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(
    ...         search_text='firefox',
    ...         status=[QuestionStatus.OPEN, QuestionStatus.INVALID]):
    ...     print repr(question.title), question.status.title, (
    ...           question.target.displayname)
    u'Problemas de Impress\xe3o no Firefox'     Open    Mozilla Firefox
    u'Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM' Invalid mozilla-firefox in ubuntu
    u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'       Open    Mozilla Firefox
    u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site'          Open    Mozilla Firefox
    u'Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site' Open    Mozilla Firefox
    u'\u0639\u0643\u0633 ...'                   Open    Ubuntu


=== Sort Order ===

When using the search_text criteria, the default is to sort the results
by relevancy. One can use the sort parameter to change that. It takes
one of the constant defined in the QuestionSort enumeration.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import QuestionSort
    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(
    ...         search_text='firefox', sort=QuestionSort.OLDEST_FIRST):
    ...     print question.id, repr(question.title), (
    ...          question.target.displayname)
    14 u'\u0639\u0643\u0633 ...'                   Ubuntu
    1 u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site'           Mozilla Firefox
    2 u'Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site'  Mozilla Firefox
    4 u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'        Mozilla Firefox
    6 u"Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used" Mozilla Firefox
    9 u'mailto: problem in webpage'                mozilla-firefox in ubuntu
    13 u'Problemas de Impress\xe3o no Firefox'     Mozilla Firefox

When no text search is done, the default sort order is
QuestionSort.NEWEST_FIRST.

    >>> for question in question_set.searchQuestions(
    ...     status=QuestionStatus.OPEN)[:5]:
    ...     print question.id, repr(question.title), (
    ...         question.target.displayname)
    13 u'Problemas de Impress\xe3o no Firefox'   Mozilla Firefox
    12 u'Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp (doble-n\xfacleo)' Ubuntu
    11 u'Continue playing after shutdown'          Ubuntu
     5 u'Installation failed'                      Ubuntu
     4 u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'       Mozilla Firefox


== getQuestionLanguages() ==

The getQuestionLanguages() method returns the set of languages in which
questions are written in Launchpad.

    >>> sorted([language.code
    ...         for language in question_set.getQuestionLanguages()])
    [u'ar', u'en', u'es', u'pt_BR']


== getActiveProjects() ==

This method can be used to retrieve the projects that are the most
actively using the Answer Tracker in the last 60 days. By active, we
mean that the project is registered as officially using Answers and
had some questions asked in the period. The projects are ordered
by the number of questions asked during the period.

Sample data should not contain any questions more recent than
two months, so no projects are initially returned:

    >>> for project in question_set.getMostActiveProjects():
    ...     print project.displayname

Create recent questions on a number of projects.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.answertracker import (
    ...     QuestionFactory)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, ILaunchBag, IProductSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> landscape = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('landscape')
    >>> launchpad = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('launchpad')

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> QuestionFactory.createManyByProject([
    ...     ('ubuntu', 3),
    ...     ('firefox', 2),
    ...     ('landscape', 1)])

Create a question just before the time limit on Launchpad.

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> question = launchpad.newQuestion(
    ...     no_priv, 'Launchpad question', 'A question',
    ...     datecreated=datetime.now(UTC) - timedelta(days=61))
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

The method returns only projects which officially use the Answer
Tracker. The order of the returned projects is based on the number of
questions asked during the period.

    >>> ubuntu.official_answers
    True
    >>> firefox.official_answers
    True
    >>> landscape.official_answers
    False
    >>> launchpad.official_answers
    True

    >>> for project in question_set.getMostActiveProjects():
    ...     print project.displayname
    Ubuntu
    Mozilla Firefox

(Launchpad is not returned because the question was not asked in
the last 60 days.)

The method accepts an optional limit parameter limiting the number of
project returned:

    >>> for project in question_set.getMostActiveProjects(limit=1):
    ...     print project.displayname
    Ubuntu
