    <dl class="faq" style="max-width: 60em">

        <dt>Why do I need to have an account to report or comment on a bug?</dt>

            <dd>
            We require an account to access the Launchpad bug tracker
            based on the following rationale:
            <ul>
              <li>It makes it possible to contact the original reporter to
              request more information, offer him better support, and
              notify him when the bug he has filed is fixed.</li>
              <li>It also reduces the risk of comments and bugs being
              filed by spambots and other unattended agents.</li>
              <li>Creating a Launchpad account is straightforward;
              it only requires five minutes and an email address.</li>
            </ul>
            </dd>

        <dt>Does Launchpad host Bazaar (bzr) branches? How do I set one
        up? Can it be a branch to which multiple people can commit?</dt>

           <dd>
           We do host Launchpad branches. You can easily set one up, and
           yes, the branches can be shared. To find out how, <a
           href="/bazaar">read more about Bazaar and Launchpad</a>.
           </dd>

        <dt>I discovered I already have an account registered in
        Launchpad. How did that happen, and how do I activate it?</dt>
            <dd>
            In certain situations Launchpad pre-creates people, based on
            email address, in its database:
            <ul>
              <li>If your email address is indicated in a source package
              imported into Launchpad; this includes all packages in
              Ubuntu.</li>
              <li>If you had an account in the Ubuntu Bugzilla bug
              tracker.</li>
              <li>If you were indicated as Last-Translator in a
              translation file included in Ubuntu or uploaded to
              Launchpad.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            These accounts are inactive, and their email address is not
            displayed anywhere in Launchpad. Launchpad only uses that
            information to satisfy referential integrity constraints in
            the database (and to allow us to credit you on the work you
            have done in the open source world!)
            </p>
            <p>
            An easy way to find out if Launchpad already created an
            account for you is <a
            href="https://launchpad.net/people/">searching through
            Launchpad accounts</a> for your name or email addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you discover Launchpad has already created an account for
            you, claiming it is easy: just <a
            href="/+forgottenpassword">request a new password for
            it</a>. If you don't know what email address was used when
            creating that account, just <a href="/feedback">contact a Launchpad
            administrator</a>.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>I discovered I have two accounts registered in Launchpad.
        How did that happen, and how do I fix it?</dt>

            <dd>
            See the previous question for an explanation of why
            Launchpad may have created an account automatically.
            <p>
            If you already have a Launchpad account, claiming a second
            account that belongs to you is easy:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Log in to Launchpad using the account you would like
              to keep.</li>
              <li>Visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/people/+requestmerge">https://launchpad.net/people/+requestmerge</a>.</li>
              <li>Enter the name or email address of the duplicated account you
              discovered.</li>
              <li>A message will be sent to each email address
              registered for that account.  Follow the instructions in
              the confirmation message, and the merge will be complete.
              All information (translations, bugs, etc.) associated to
              that account will be transferred to your Launchpad
              account.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            If you no longer have access to an email address registered
            for your duplicate account, you can request a <a
            href="https://launchpad.net/~admins">Launchpad
            administrator</a> for assistance in merging your accounts.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>Who gets emailed when I upload a source package to Launchpad?</dt>
            <dd>
            It depends. Launchpad sends out two emails in the most common
            case, which is that of:
            <ul>
              <li>a package being uploaded to the release pocket of a
              release which is open for development</li>
              <li>an upload which passes all of required tests</li>
              <li>an upload which does not need intervention from the distribution
            managers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Of those two emails,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first is sent to the distribution release's
              changes list.</li>
              <li>The second is sent to people associated with the
              changes file. The people considered are:
              <ul>
                <li>the signer of the changes file;</li>
                <li>the person listed in the Maintainer field;</li>
                <li>the person listed in the Changed-By field.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              If a selected email address is associated to a Launchpad
              account that is a member of a team permitted to upload to
              the distribution (ubuntu-core-dev for Ubuntu, for
              example), it will receive a notification of the upload.
              </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </dd>

        <dt>Is Launchpad Free Software/open source? If not, why not?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Launchpad is not currently Free Software.
            There are several reasons for this.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Launchpad exists not just to make development easier within
                projects, but also to encourage collaboration between projects
                (for example, by sharing bug reports and translations).
                Several Launchpads running on separate sites would make this
                collaboration harder if not impossible.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Launchpad is non-trivial to contribute to.
                There is a complex code review, QA, and rollout process
                that makes it impractical for people interested in making a
                short one-off contribution.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Launchpad is non-trivial to run.
                It has dozens of moving parts,
                including about six core servers used for day-to-day operations,
                and about ten used for the services which we call upon to
                collect data.
                Running a similar site would be a non-trivial production
                exercise, and the code and documentation have not been written
                to make any of this easily deployable.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We intend to release all of Launchpad as Free Software gradually,
            though it may be years before that is finished.
            So far we have released
            <a href="https://launchpad.net/launchpad-cscvs">CSCVS</a>,
            for mirroring CVS/Subversion trees to Bazaar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Launchpad&rsquo;s development has, however, involved us making many
            contributions to other Free Software projects. These include
            <a href="">Zope</a>,
            <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>,
            <a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>,
            and <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>.
          </p>

        <dt>Launchpad is down for maintenance.  How long before it comes back?</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>
            Normally, Launchpad is updated every Tuesday, generally
            around 10:00 UTC. This normally results in 30 minutes of
            downtime as the production servers are upgraded.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are other -- exceptional -- situations in which
            Launchpad may become unavailable. When it is a planned
            outage, email is sent to the <a
            href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/launchpad-users">Launchpad
            users mailing list</a> notifying when, and how long.
            Unpredictable outages are unfortunately, well,
            unpredictable; however, the servers are maintained by a
            dedicated team that is very responsive, and downtime is
            normally minimal.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>Can I translate Launchpad itself into my language?</dt>
            <dd>
            You can't, yet. Launchpad is still in the process of having
            its templates assembled and published, and the
            infrastructure for serving different languages is not yet
            ready. When this happens, we'll be sure to make a public
            announcement and invite community translators.
            </dd>

        <dt>How long will it take for my CDs to arrive? Will you really
        send me CDs for free?</dt>
            <dd>
            You should be looking at the <a
            href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/faq?action=show&amp;redirect=support%2Fdocumentation%2Ffaq%2Fshipit#head-7eef2db63e0a75424cdd663ee6f7b8eedcf19607">Shipit FAQ</a>.

        <dt>What are the copyright terms for contributing to Rosetta?</dt>

            <dd>
            See our <a href="/legal">legal details page</a>.
            </dd>

        <dt>How do I contact a Launchpad administrator?</dt>

            <dd>The <a href="/people/admins">Launchpad
            administrators</a> are a group of people that have
            special powers inside Launchpad; they are usually able to
            solve most simple problems related to user accounts.
            <p>
            The best way to get prompt attention from an administrator
            is though IRC, as detailed in our <a
            href="/feedback">feedback page</a>. You can also resort to
            emailing them directly.</dd>
