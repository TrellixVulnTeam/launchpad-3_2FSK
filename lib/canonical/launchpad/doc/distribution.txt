Distributions
=============

From the DerivationOverview spec[1]:

    A distribution of GNU/Linux comprises a set of packages, an installer,
    possibly a live-CD, some amount of metadata associated with the arrangement
    of those elements and also a lot of information on managing it.

In Launchpad, one distribution is mapped to one row in the Distribution table.
To retrieve a distribution, use the IDistributionSet utility. If you've already
used IPersonSet to retrieve a Person, or IBugTaskSet to retrieve a task, this
syntax should look familiar.

Let's simulate interacting with the system as an anonymous user:

    >>> import zope.security.management
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPerson
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
    >>> class Principal:
    ...     def __init__(self, id):
    ...         self.id = id
    ...         self.groups = []
    >>> principal = Principal('launchpad.anonymous')

    >>> class Participation:
    ...     interaction = None
    >>> anon_participation = Participation()
    >>> anon_participation.principal = principal

    >>> zope.security.management.newInteraction(anon_participation)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag
    >>> from zope.app.tests import ztapi
    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> class MockLaunchBag(object):
    ...     implements(ILaunchBag)
    ...     def __init__(self, login=None, user=None):
    ...         self.login = login
    ...         self.user = user
    >>> launchbag = MockLaunchBag()
    >>> ztapi.provideUtility(ILaunchBag, launchbag)

The IDistributionSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> distroset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)

To retrieve a specific distribution, use IDistributionSet.get:

    >>> ubuntu = distroset.get(1)
    >>> print ubuntu.name
    ubuntu

    >>> ztapi.unprovideUtility(ILaunchBag)
    >>> zope.security.management.endInteraction()
