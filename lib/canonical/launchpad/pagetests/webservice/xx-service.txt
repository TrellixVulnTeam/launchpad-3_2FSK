Some standard behavior is defined by the web service itself, not by
the individual resources.


== Nonexistent resources ==

An attempt to access a nonexistent resource yields a 404 error.

  >>> print webservice.get("/no-such-resource")
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...


== Nonexistent methods ==

An attempt to use an unsupported or nonexistent HTTP method on a
resource yields a 405 error.

  >>> print webservice("/", method="COPY")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET HEAD POST PATCH PUT DELETE OPTIONS
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/people")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/people/salgado")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET PUT PATCH
  ...


== Inappropriate media types ==

An attempt to PATCH a document with unsupported media type to a
resource yields a 415 error.

  >>> print webservice.patch("/people/salgado", 'text/plain', "Foo")
  HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
