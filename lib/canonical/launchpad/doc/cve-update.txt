= CVE IMPORT PROCESS =

Launchpad has a cronscript (in "cronscripts/update-cve.py") that will fetch
the latest CVE database, in XML format, from the web, and then ensure that
the CVE data in it is correctly reflected in the local Launchpad database.
It takes care to reflect the correct description, status (Entry, Candidate,
or Deprecated), as well as all the References for that CVE entry.

This documentation test will describe and test the behaviour of this
infrastructure. Note that it assumes that the XML format is not changing,
and it does not attempt to connect to the outside world to verify that is
the case.

    >>> import subprocess, os.path, sys
    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates

OK. So now lets import the first XML database. First, lets se how many CVE
entries are in the database.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Cve
    >>> print Cve.select().count()
    10

    >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, 'cronscripts', 'update-cve.py')
    >>> url_base = os.path.join(
    ...     config.root, 'lib', 'canonical', 'launchpad', 'scripts', 'tests'
    ...     )

Now run the cronscript.

    >>> url = 'file://%s' % os.path.join(url_base, 'cvedb_init.xml.gz')
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [sys.executable, script, '-u', url], stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
    ...     )
    >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
    >>> print output
    INFO    creating lockfile
    ...
    INFO    CVE-1999-0002 created
    INFO    Creating new SGI reference for 1999-0002
    INFO    Creating new BID reference for 1999-0002
    INFO    Creating new XF reference for 1999-0002
    INFO    CVE-1999-0003 created
    INFO    Creating new CERT reference for 1999-0003

    INFO    Creating new CERT reference for 1999-0007

    INFO    CVE-2005-2763 created
    INFO    CVE-2005-2764 created
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>

And lets make sure we got the right number of CVE entries.

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print Cve.select().count()
    18

We will make a note of the CVE modification time of 1999-0002. When we
update it later, we can use this modification time to check that its
modification time is being updated correctly.

    >>> c = Cve.bySequence('2005-2734')
    >>> mod_time = c.datemodified

And while we are here, make a note of the number of references for that CVE
entry.

    >>> print c.references.count()
    6

Now, let's run an import of the update db.

    >>> url = 'file://%s' % os.path.join(url_base, 'cvedb_update.xml.gz')
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [sys.executable, script, '-u', url], stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
    ...     )
    >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
    >>> print output
    INFO    creating lockfile

    ...
    <BLANKLINE>

Let's make sure we got the new CVE's.

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print Cve.select().count()
    21

And lets make sure the modification time of 2005-2734 was updated, as were
the number of comments.

    >>> c.sync()
    >>> print mod_time < c.datemodified
    True
    >>> print c.references.count()
    0

== Script class ==

The class the conscript uses to do its work is CVEUpdater.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.cveimport import CVEUpdater
