= Private PPA Subscription Stories =

The owner or admin of a private PPA can add subscribers - people
or teams - to the private archive. This will enable subscribers to obtain
a custom sources.list entry and access the repository.

The owner or admin of a private archive can also edit or cancel
subscribers related to the archive.

== Setup Helpers ==

Just so the definition of these helpers doesn't get in the way of the
story text, define them here.

First create a helper function for printing the archive subscriptions
of a person:

    >>> def print_subscriptions_for_person(contents):
    ...     subscriptions = find_tags_by_class(contents,
    ...                                        'archive-subscription-row')
    ...     for subscription in subscriptions:
    ...         print extract_text(subscription)

== Story: An archive owner can add a subscription for a private archive ==

 * As a software developer who plans to release some private software
 * I want to add certain users or teams as subscribers of my PPA
 * So that they can download my software.

=== Scenario 1: A user is added as a subscriber ===

Given a private PPA for Celso

    >>> admin_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa")
    >>> admin_browser.getLink("Administer archive").click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="field.private").value = True
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="field.buildd_secret").value = "secret"
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Save").click()

And a browser for Celso currently navigated to the Manage Subscriptions page

XXX: noodles 2009-03-10 bug=340405. The the +subscriptions traversal
will require launchpad.Admin until the backend .htaccess update
machinery is in-place and tested:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> admins = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('admins')
    >>> admins.addMember(cprov, foobar)
    >>> logout()

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:cprov")
    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions")

And a client of Celso's who has a launchpad name of 'joesmith'

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> client = factory.makePerson(name="joesmith", displayname="Joe Smith",
    ...     password="test", email="joe@example.com")
    >>> logout()

When Celso fills in the form with 'joesmith' as the subscriber
And a blank subscription expiry
And a description of "Joe is my friend"
And clicks on the "Add subscriber" button

    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name='field.subscriber').value = 'joesmith'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.description').value = "Joe is my friend"
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="field.actions.add").click()

Then Celso is redirected to the subscribers page
And the new subscription is displayed,
And a notification about the new subscriber is also displayed.

Create a helper function to print subscriptions:
    >>> def print_archive_subscriptions(contents):
    ...     subscriptions = find_tags_by_class(contents,
    ...                                        'archive_subscriber_row')
    ...     for subscription in subscriptions:
    ...         print extract_text(subscription)

    >>> print_archive_subscriptions(cprov_browser.contents)
    Name                Expires     Comment
    Joe Smith                       Joe is my friend    Edit/Cancel

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    Joe Smith has been added as a subscriber.

=== Scenario 2: A team is added as a subscriber ===

Given a private PPA for Celso
And a browser for Celso currently navigated to the Manage Subscriptions page

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions")

When Celso fills in the form with the 'launchpad' team as the subscriber
And an expiry date of '2200-08-01'
And a description of "Launchpad developer access."
And clicks on the "Add subscriber" button

    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name='field.subscriber').value = 'launchpad'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.date_expires').value = '2200-08-01'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.description').value = "Launchpad developer access."
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="field.actions.add").click()

Then Celso is redirected to the subscribers page
And the new subscription for the launchpad team is displayed,
And a notification about the new subscriber is also displayed.

    >>> print_archive_subscriptions(cprov_browser.contents)
    Name                    Expires       Comment
    Launchpad Developers    2200-08-01    Launchpad developer access.
    ...

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    Launchpad Developers has been added as a subscriber.

== Story 2: An owner edits a subscription for his private archive ==

 * As a software developer who has released some private software
 * I want to edit subscriptions to my private PPA
 * So that I can adjust who can download my software.

=== Scenario 1: Adjusting the details of a subscription ===

Given a private PPA for Celso
and a subscription to Celso's private PPA for the Launchpad Developers team
and a browser for Celso currently navigated to the Manage Subscriptions page

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions")


When Celso clicks 'Edit/Cancel' for the Launchpad Developers subscription
and modifies the description field
and clicks Update

    >>> cprov_browser.getLink(
    ...     url='/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions/launchpad/+edit').click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="field.description").value = (
    ...     "a different description")
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="field.actions.update").click()

Then the browser is redirected back to the subscriptions page
and the updated subscription for the launchpad team is displayed
and a notification about the update is also displayed.

    >>> print cprov_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions
    >>> print_archive_subscriptions(cprov_browser.contents)
    Name                    Expires       Comment
    Launchpad Developers    2200-08-01    a different description
    ...
    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    The subscription for Launchpad Developers has been updated.

=== Scenario 2: Canceling a subscription ===

Given a private PPA for Celso
and a subscription to Celso's private PPA for the Launchpad Developers team
and a browser for Celso currently navigated to the Manage Subscriptions page

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions")


When Celso clicks 'Edit/Cancel' for the Launchpad Developers subscription
and clicks Cancel

    >>> cprov_browser.getLink(
    ...     url='/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions/launchpad/+edit').click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="field.actions.cancel").click()

Then the browser is redirected back to the subscriptions page
and the canceled subscription is no longer displayed
and a notification about the cancellation is displayed.

    >>> print cprov_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+subscriptions
    >>> print_archive_subscriptions(cprov_browser.contents)
    Name                    Expires       Comment
    Joe Smith                             Joe is my friend    Edit/Cancel

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    The subscription for Launchpad Developers has been canceled.


== Story 3: A subscriber activates a subscription ==

 * As a user of Celso's software,
 * I want to obtain a private sources.list entry
 * So that I can download and get updates for the software in
   Celso's private PPA.

=== Scenario 1: A user activates a personal subscription ===

Given a subscription for Celso's private PPA

When Joe visits his private archive subscriptions page:

XXX: noodles 2009-03-10 bug=340405. The the +subscriptions traversal
will require launchpad.Admin until the backend .htaccess update
machinery is in-place and tested:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> admins.addMember(client, foobar)
    >>> logout()

    >>> joe_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic joe@example.com:test")
    >>> joe_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~joesmith/+archivesubscriptions")

Then a list of all Joe's pending subscriptions is displayed, each with an
Activate button

    >>> for row in find_tags_by_class(joe_browser.contents,
    ...                               "pending-archive-subscription-row"):
    ...     print extract_text(row)
    ...     if row.find('input', type="submit", value="Activate"):
    ...         print "Activate"
    Archive                             Subscription description
    Private PPA for Celso Providelo     Joe is my friend          Activate

And no private_sources.list file is displayed (as there are no active
subscriptions)

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(joe_browser.contents, 'sources_list')
    None

And a list of all Joe's subscriptions is displayed

    >>> print_subscriptions_for_person(joe_browser.contents)
    Archive                             Subscription description Status
    Private PPA for Celso Providelo     Joe is my friend         Pending

When Joe clicks on the 'Activate subscription' button for Celso's PPA

    >>> joe_browser.getControl(
    ...     name="field.actions.activate_archive_9").click()

Then there is no longer a list of pending subscriptions displayed

    >>> print find_tags_by_class(joe_browser.contents,
    ...                          "pending-archive-subscription-row")
    []

And a sources.list snippet is now included

    >>> sources_list = find_tag_by_id(joe_browser.contents, 'sources_list')
    >>> print(extract_text(sources_list))
    Custom sources.list entries
    ...
    # Personal subscriptions for private PPAs
    # Private PPA for Celso Providelo
    deb http://joesmith:...@private-ppa.launchpad.dev/cprov/ppa/ubuntu hoary main
    deb-src http://joesmith:...@private-ppa.launchpad.dev/cprov/ppa/ubuntu hoary main

And the list of Joe's current subscriptions reflects the correct status

    >>> print_subscriptions_for_person(joe_browser.contents)
    Archive                             Subscription description Status
    Private PPA for Celso Providelo     Joe is my friend         Active

And a notification message is displayed on the screen

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(joe_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    Your subscription to 'Private PPA for Celso Providelo' has been activated.
    Please update your custom sources.list as described below.

=== Scenario 2: A user activates a team subscription ===

== Story 4: A user's subscription expires or is cancelled ==

 * As a user of Celso's software
 * I want to know (eventually, be notified) when my subscription expires
 * So that I understand why I can no longer download Celso's software

=== Scenario 1: Accessing details for an expired subscription ===

Given an expired subscription for Celso's private PPA

When Andrew visits his subscriptions
Then the page clearly identifies the subscription as no longer valid
And there is no entry in the sources.list for the expired subscription.

=== Scenario 2: Accessing details for a cancelled subscription ===

Given a cancelled subscription for Celso's private PPA

When Andrew visits his subscriptions
Then the page clearly identifies the subscription as no longer valid
And there is no entry in the sources.list for the expired subscription.
