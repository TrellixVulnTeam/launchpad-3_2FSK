= A team's home page =

The home page of a team is publicly visible and contains a few interesting
details about the team.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
    <...
    <h1>Ubuntu Team</h1>
    ...
    <h2>Recently approved</h2>
    ...Celso Providelo...
    <h2>Recently applied</h2>
    ...Warty Security Team...
    <h2>Contact details</h2>
    ...
    <h2>Subteam of</h2>
    ...is a member of these teams:
    ...
    <h2>Your involvement</h2>
    ...
    You must ...log in...to join or leave this team.
    ...

In the above case there's no user logged in, so it doesn't actually show
what's the user's involvement with the team. If the user logs in, he'll see
that, though.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
    <...
    <h2>Your involvement</h2>
    ...
    You are a member of this team.
    ...

If the logged in user is an indirect member of the team, we'll say that and
will even show the path from the user to the team.

    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name18')
    >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
    <...
    <h2>Your involvement</h2>
    ...
    You are an indirect member of this team:
