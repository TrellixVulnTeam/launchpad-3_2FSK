= Branch Visibility Policy =

The branch visibility policy is used to define the default visibility
of branches when they are created.

Both projects and products can define a branch visibility policy.  If a
policy does not exist for a product, it uses the policy defined by its
project (if it exists).

The information is saved in the database table BranchVisibilityPolicy.
This table effectively creates tuples of (Project or Product, Team,
Policy).  Since there is no team that is used to define everyone, the
non-specifying of a team means *everyone*.

The Policy is defined by the enumerated type BranchVisibilityPolicy.

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import BranchVisibilityPolicy

There are currently four visibility policies:
 * Public - branches are public by default for the specified team.
 * Private - branches are private by default for the specified team.
 * Private only - branches are private by default, and the owner
     of the branch is not able to make them public.
 * Forbidden - members of the specified team are not able to create
     branches in the context.

    >>> for item in BranchVisibilityPolicy.items:
    ...     print repr(item)
    <Item PUBLIC (1) from ...>
    <Item PRIVATE (2) from ...>
    <Item PRIVATE_ONLY (3) from ...>
    <Item FORBIDDEN (4) from ...>


== IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy ==

The interface IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy is used to define the public
interface for modifying the branch visibility policy items.  Both
IProject and IProduct inherit from this interface as both projects and
products can set branch visibility policies.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IProjectSet, IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy)
    >>> project_set = getUtility(IProjectSet)
    >>> mozilla = project_set.getByName('mozilla')
    >>> IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy.providedBy(mozilla)
    True
    >>> verifyObject(IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy, mozilla)
    True

    >>> firefox, thunderbird = list(mozilla.products)

    >>> IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy.providedBy(firefox)
    True
    >>> verifyObject(IHasBranchVisibilityPolicy, firefox)
    True


== Teams to work with ==

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> launchpad_team = person_set.getByName('launchpad')
    >>> ubuntu_gnome_team = person_set.getByName('name18')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> launchpad = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('launchpad')
    >>> evolution = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')

    >>> def teamname(team):
    ...     if team is None:
    ...         return "*everyone*"
    ...     else:
    ...         return team.displayname

    >>> def print_policy_items(context):
    ...     for item in context.branch_visibility_policy_items:
    ...         print "%s: %s" % (teamname(item.team), item.policy.title)


== Default policy ==

There is an implicit policy defined for all contexts.  The implicit
policy is that everyone can create public branches.  The implicit policy
is not returned with the items attribute.  In order to override this
implicit policy you need to explicitly define a policy for everyone, and
this is done by specifying None for the team.

    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    >>> evolution.branch_visibility_base_policy
    <Item PUBLIC ...BranchVisibilityPolicy...
    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PUBLIC)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Public
    >>> evolution.branch_visibility_base_policy
    <Item PUBLIC ...BranchVisibilityPolicy...


== Setting the policy for teams ==

Setting the policy for a team overrides any existing policy that may
exist for that team.

    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     launchpad_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PUBLIC)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Public
    Launchpad Developers: Public

Setting again replaces the policy.

    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     launchpad_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PRIVATE)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Public
    Launchpad Developers: Private

Setting the policy for *everyone* is done by passing None for the team.

    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.FORBIDDEN)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Forbidden
    Launchpad Developers: Private
    >>> evolution.branch_visibility_base_policy
    <Item FORBIDDEN ...BranchVisibilityPolicy...


== Removing teams from the policy object ==

    >>> evolution.removeTeamFromBranchVisibilityPolicy(launchpad_team)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Forbidden

Attempting to remove a team that doesn't exist is allowed, but does not
change the state of the policy object.

    >>> evolution.removeTeamFromBranchVisibilityPolicy(launchpad_team)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Forbidden

In order to remove a policy assigned to everyone you pass None in for
the team name.

    >>> evolution.removeTeamFromBranchVisibilityPolicy(None)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)


== Listing the policy items ==

Policy items are listed in alphabetical order of the team display name
with the policy for *everybody* being first.

    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     ubuntu_gnome_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PRIVATE)
    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     launchpad_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PRIVATE)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    Launchpad Developers: Private
    Ubuntu Gnome Team: Private

    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PUBLIC)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Public
    Launchpad Developers: Private
    Ubuntu Gnome Team: Private


== Inherited policy items ==

Products can inherit the branch visibility policy items of their
projects.  If a product has no project, then there are no inherited
items to inherit.

    >>> print mozilla.isUsingInheritedBranchVisibilityPolicy()
    False

The inherited behaviour is only used if there are no explicit policy
items set

    >>> print thunderbird.isUsingInheritedBranchVisibilityPolicy()
    True

Since the Launchpad product doesn't have a project associated with it,
there is no inherited policy.

    >>> print launchpad.isUsingInheritedBranchVisibilityPolicy()
    False

Adding a team to the mozilla project will also affect products
associated with the mozilla project that are inheriting the project's
branch policy.

    >>> mozilla.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     ubuntu_gnome_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PRIVATE)
    >>> mozilla.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PRIVATE)

    >>> print_policy_items(mozilla)
    *everyone*: Private
    Ubuntu Gnome Team: Private

    >>> print_policy_items(thunderbird)
    *everyone*: Private
    Ubuntu Gnome Team: Private

In order to avoid inheriting the policy of the project, there just needs
to be an explicit policy item for the product.  This explicit item could
even be the same as the default policy.

    >>> thunderbird.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PUBLIC)
    >>> print thunderbird.isUsingInheritedBranchVisibilityPolicy()
    False
    >>> print_policy_items(thunderbird)
    *everyone*: Public


== Policy checks during branch creation ==

The branch visibility policy is checked during branch creation through
the IBranchSet utility.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
    >>> branch_set = getUtility(IBranchSet)
    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     None, BranchVisibilityPolicy.FORBIDDEN)
    >>> vcs_imports_team = person_set.getByName('vcs-imports')
    >>> evolution.setTeamBranchVisibilityPolicy(
    ...     vcs_imports_team, BranchVisibilityPolicy.PUBLIC)
    >>> print_policy_items(evolution)
    *everyone*: Forbidden
    Launchpad Developers: Private
    Ubuntu Gnome Team: Private
    VCS imports: Public

    >>> foo_bar = person_set.getByEmail("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> stevea = person_set.getByName("stevea")
    >>> ddaa = person_set.getByName("ddaa")

Foo Bar is a member of both Launchpad Developers and Ubuntu Gnome Team.

    >>> foo_bar.inTeam(launchpad_team)
    True
    >>> foo_bar.inTeam(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    True
    >>> foo_bar.inTeam(vcs_imports_team)
    True

If Foo Bar is creating a branch for evolution, the branch would be created
as a private branch, but since there are two teams that specify privacy,
the branch is created so only Foo Bar can see it.  It is up to Foo Bar to
subscribe the appropriate team at a later date.

    >>> branch = branch_set.new(
    ...     name="testing-1", creator=foo_bar, owner=foo_bar,
    ...     product=evolution, url=None)
    >>> branch.private
    True
    >>> branch.subscribers.count()
    0

Steve is a member of the Ubuntu Gnome Team, but not the Launchpad
Developers team, so branches that are created by Steve are private
and are subscribed to by the Ubuntu Gnome Team.

    >>> stevea.inTeam(launchpad_team)
    False
    >>> stevea.inTeam(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    True
    >>> stevea.inTeam(vcs_imports_team)
    False

    >>> branch = branch_set.new(
    ...     name="testing-2", creator=stevea, owner=stevea,
    ...     product=evolution, url=None)
    >>> branch.private
    True
    >>> for subscriber in branch.subscribers:
    ...     print subscriber.browsername
    Ubuntu Gnome Team

Since David is a member of VCS Imports but not a member of the other two
teams that have private branches, David's branch will be public.

    >>> ddaa.inTeam(launchpad_team)
    False
    >>> ddaa.inTeam(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    False
    >>> ddaa.inTeam(vcs_imports_team)
    True

    >>> branch = branch_set.new(
    ...     name="testing-3", creator=ddaa, owner=ddaa,
    ...     product=evolution, url=None)
    >>> branch.private
    False
    >>> branch.subscribers.count()
    0

People that are not members of any of the specified teams get the
base visibility policy, which is Forbidden.

    >>> no_priv = person_set.getByEmail("no-priv@canonical.com")

    >>> no_priv.inTeam(launchpad_team)
    False
    >>> no_priv.inTeam(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    False
    >>> no_priv.inTeam(vcs_imports_team)
    False

    >>> branch = branch_set.new(
    ...     name="testing-4", creator=no_priv, owner=no_priv,
    ...     product=evolution, url=None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
