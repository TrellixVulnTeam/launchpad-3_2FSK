= Authentication for feeds =

Requests made to feeds.launchpad.dev are not challenged for
authentication, so most access is done anonymously.  In the event a
request provides basic authentication, even though not requested by
the server, the web application will nonetheless use the
unauthenticated anonymous user for all interaction.

    >>> foo_bar_auth = 'Basic %s' % (
    ...     'foo.bar@canonical.com:test'.encode('base64'))

    # Setup a Foo Bar user and let Zope handle the errors.
    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.handleErrors = True

    # First, get the bug through the web site, to ensure the
    # bug exists and is private.
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/14')
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/bugs/14

    # Traversing to the private bug will trigger an Unauthorized error
    # and the user will be redirected to +login. Since that page isn't
    # available on feeds, we get a NotFound error.
    >>> browser.open('http://feeds.launchpad.dev/bugs/14/bug.atom')
