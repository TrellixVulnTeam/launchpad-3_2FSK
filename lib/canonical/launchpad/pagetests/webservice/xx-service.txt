Some standard behavior is defined by the web service itself, not by
the individual resources.

== Nonexistent resources ==

An attempt to access a nonexistent resource yields a 404 error.

  >>> print http(r"""

  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...

== Nonexistent methods ==

An attempt to use an unsupported or nonexistent HTTP method on a
resource yields a 405 error.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... COPY / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET HEAD POST PATCH PUT DELETE OPTIONS
  ...

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... DELETE /people HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ...

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... DELETE /~salgado HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed

== Inappropriate media types ==

An attempt to PATCH a document with unsupported media type to a
resource yields a 415 error.

  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... Content-type: text/plain
  ...

  ...

    ...     GET /+builds HTTP/1.1
    ...     Host: api.launchpad.dev
    ...     """))
