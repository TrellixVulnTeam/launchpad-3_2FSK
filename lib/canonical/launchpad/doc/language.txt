    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> language_set = getUtility(ILanguageSet)

We can get hold of languages by their language code.

    >>> language = language_set['es']
    >>> language.englishname
    u'Spanish'

We can convert language codes to standard form.

    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt')
    'pt'
    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt_BR')
    'pt_BR'
    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt-br')
    'pt_BR'

We can even get hold of many at once. Language codes will be converted to
standard form and unknown codes will be ignored.

    >>> languages = language_set.codes_to_languages(['es', 'pt_BR', 'zz'])
    >>> [language.englishname for language in languages]
    [u'Spanish', u'Portuguese (Brazil)']


Suggestion Source Languages
---------------------------

In some languages, you could reasonably expect to find good suggestions in a
second language. They might not be perfect but they are useful nonetheless.

pt_BR is not a descendent of pt:

    >>> pt_BR = language_set['pt_BR']
    >>> print pt_BR.alt_suggestion_language
    None

However, es_MX would find es useful:

    >>> print language_set['es_MX'].alt_suggestion_language.code
    es

And Nynorsk and Bokmal have a special relationship:

    >>> print language_set['nn'].alt_suggestion_language.code
    nb
    
    >>> print language_set['nb'].alt_suggestion_language.code
    nn
