= BuildFarm page =

The BuildFarm page is accessible from the root page, although we don't
link to it yet because we are not yet sure of the benefits of doing
this, since the audience of this page is still restricted.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+builds')

The BuildFarm contains a list of all builders registered in Launchpad
ordered by architecture and a short summary about what they are
processing.

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    PPA build machines
    386  0 builds waiting in queue
    The frog builder   Disabled
    Official distribution build machines
    386  1 builds waiting in queue
    Bob The Builder    Disabled
    Generated at ...

As we can see, this page also presents the number of builds waiting
in queue for each supported architecture on each separated build-farm
we have, 'ppa' and 'other' (PRIMARY and PARTNER).

    >>> def print_depth(contents):
    ...     depths = find_tags_by_class(contents, 'highlighted')
    ...     for depth in depths:
    ...         print extract_text(depth)

    >>> print_depth(anon_browser.contents)
    386     0 builds waiting in queue
    386     1 builds waiting in queue

In order to test the 'ppa' build queue depth portlet we will retry
a failed build in Celso's PPA.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     BuildStatus, IPersonSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> failed_build = cprov.archive.getBuildRecords(
    ...     build_state=BuildStatus.FAILEDTOBUILD)[0]
    >>> unused = failed_build.retry()

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

Now we can see the populated section for the ppa build-farm,
exposing one pending build record. The 'other' is still present.

    >>> anon_browser.reload()
    >>> print_depth(anon_browser.contents)
    386     1 builds waiting in queue
    386     1 builds waiting in queue

From this page, users with the appropriate permission can register new
builders.

    >>> admin_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+index")
    >>> admin_browser.getLink("Register a new build machine").click()
    >>> print admin_browser.title
    Register a new build machine

While anonymous users are not given the option to register a new build
and are not permitted if they go directly to the URL.
