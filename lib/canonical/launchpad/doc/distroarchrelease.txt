Distro Arch Releases can tell you about their published releases.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distro Arch Releases have a number of releases of any given binary
package in them. This can be due to various reasons such as uploads in
progress, superseding in progress, or simply that there is more than
one version spread across the pockets. getReleasedPackages lets us
interrogate this information.

   >>> for p in hoary_i386.getReleasedPackages("pmount"):
   ...     print p.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name
