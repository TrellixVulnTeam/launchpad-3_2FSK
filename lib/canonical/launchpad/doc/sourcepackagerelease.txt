Source Package Release
======================

The SourcePackageRelease table represents a particular release of a
SourcePackageName, but isn't tied to any particular DistroRelease
as the same release can appear in many.

Let's get one from the database:

   >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import SourcePackageRelease
   >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.get(14)
   >>> print spr.name
   mozilla-firefox
   >>> print spr.version
   0.9

We can use the magic productrelease property to map this to a ProductRelease:

   >>> pr = spr.productrelease
   >>> print pr.product.name
   firefox
   >>> print pr.productseries.name
   milestones
   >>> print pr.version
   0.9

It should also work when the version has a dash and packaging revision
after it:

   >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.get(16)
   >>> print spr.name
   netapplet
   >>> print spr.version
   1.0-1
   >>> pr = spr.productrelease
   >>> print pr.product.name
   netapplet
   >>> print pr.productseries.name
   releases
   >>> print pr.version
   1.0

If there isn't one, that should return None.

   >>> print SourcePackageRelease.get(20).productrelease
   None
