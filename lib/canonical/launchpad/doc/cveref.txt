Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
==========================================

Malone supports attaching CVE references to bugs. From
http://www.cve.mitre.org/about/ CVE is:

    A list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and other
    information security exposures - CVE aims to standardize the names
    for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures.

Creating CVE references
-----------------------

CVE references can be created with the ICVERefSet utility.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login("test@canonical.com")

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ICVERefSet
    >>> cverefset = getUtility(ICVERefSet)

To create a CVE reference, call ICVERefSet.createCVERef.

    >>> cveref = cverefset.createCVERef(
    ...     bug = 2, cveref = "CVE-2004-0276",
    ...     title = "a test cve ref", owner = 12)
    >>> cveref.cveref
    u'CVE-2004-0276'
