Personal Subscriptions
======================

The user should be able to subscribe and unsubscribe from bugs in
Launchpad.

When they are not subscribed, they should see the "Subscribe" link in
the actions portlet.

  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/products/firefox/+bug/1')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/products/firefox/+bug/1'

  >>> subscribe_link = browser.getLink('Subscribe')
  >>> subscribe_link.text
  'Subscribe'

If they follow that link, they should be able to see the page that asks them
if they want to subscribe. The "Subscribe" button should be visible on the
page.

  >>> subscribe_link.click()

  >>> subscription_widget = browser.getControl(name='field.subscription')
  >>> subscription_widget.options
  ['name16']
  >>> subscription_widget.value
  ['name16']

  >>> submit = browser.getControl('Continue')

Now, let's POST that back to the bug home page. It should show the user. It
should also show a message, and the link should change to "Unsubscribe".

  >>> submit.click()

  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/products/firefox/+bug/1/'

  >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.contents)
  >>> for p_tag in soup('p', 'informational message'):
  ...   print p_tag.string
  You have been subscribed to this bug.

  >>> import re
  >>> subscriber_portlet_headers = soup.fetchText(
  ...     'Subscribers to bug 1:')
  >>> len(subscriber_portlet_headers)
  1
  >>> subscriber_portlet = subscriber_portlet_headers[0].parent.parent
  >>> for li in subscriber_portlet.fetch('ul', 'people')[0].fetch('li'):
  ...   print li.a.string

Now, we want to view the +subscribe page again. It should say "Unsubscribe"
because we are now a subscriber.

  >>> subscribe_link = browser.getLink('Unsubscribe')
  >>> subscribe_link.text
  'Unsubscribe'
  >>> subscribe_link.click()
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/products/firefox/+bug/1/+subscribe'

And if we POST that back to the bug home page, we will be unsubscribed in a
spectacular fashion.

  >>> subscription_widget.value
  ['name16']
  >>> submit = browser.getControl('Continue')
  >>> submit.click()

  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/products/firefox/+bug/1/'

  >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.contents)
  >>> for p_tag in soup('p', 'informational message'):
  ...   print p_tag.string
  You have been unsubscribed from this bug.

  >>> subscribe_link = browser.getLink('Subscribe')
  >>> subscribe_link.text
  'Subscribe'
