Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with %(language)s translations for %(template)s in Launchpad.

We were unable to import your translations because you did not update the timestamp in its header to state when you added your translations.

%(error)s

To fix this problem, please upload the file again, but with the 'PO-Revision-Date' field updated.

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:
%(file_link)s

Thank you,

The Launchpad team
