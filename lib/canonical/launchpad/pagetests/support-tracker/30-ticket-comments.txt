Reopening
=========

It is possible to reopen a rejected request using the 'Reopen Request'
link. After following that link, the user should confirm the reopening
by clicking the 'Reopen' button.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Reopen Request').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Reopen').click()

A confirmation message is displayed and the status is changed back
to 'Open'.

    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(user_browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.first('p', 'informational message').renderContents()
    You have reopened this request.

    >>> print soup.first('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    Open

Additionally, a portlet listing the 'Reopenings' now appears:

    >>> porlet = soup.first(
    ...     'h4', text='This request was reopened:').findParent('div')
    >>> porlet.first('li', 'ticket')
    <li class="ticket">
        2006-09-08 by...
        <a href=".../people/name12">Sample Person</a>
    </li>

The listing of all reopenings can also be consulted by using the
'History' link.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('History').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    History of support request #2
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(user_browser.contents)
    >>> history_table = soup.first('table', 'listing')
    >>> history_table.first('tbody').first('tr')
    <tr>
        <td>2006-09-08</td>
        <td>Sample Person</td>
        <td>Invalid</td>
        <td>Sample Person</td>
        <td>2006-09-08
        </td>
    </tr>

Ticket Comments
===============

We will examine Ticket #3, on Ubuntu. When not logged in, we should not be
able to make a comment.

  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...To post a comment you must...

When logged in, we should see the ability to add a comment. The default
subject should be based on the title, since there are no existing comments.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Add comment...
  ...<input name="field.subject" type="text" size="50"...value="Re: Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM" />...

If we POST that form, we should be redirected back to the ticket page.

  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  Content-Length: 0

Now we will examine Ticket #2 on Firefox. It should currently be Open,
and w should have the ability to make a comment.

If we POST that form, we can provide an answer. This is simple a
comment, we don't have to mark the ticket as answered.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+addmessage HTTP/1.1

Finally, we will respond with a message from the person who created this
ticket, also saying it is answered. That should set the status to
