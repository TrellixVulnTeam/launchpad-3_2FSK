= Empty source package branch listings =

When you look at an empty source package branch listing, you see some nice,
helpful text.

Let's demonstrate this by making a source package with no branches and
browsing to it.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.sourcepackage import SourcePackage
    >>> def make_source_package(distro, series, name):
    ...     distro = factory.makeDistribution(name=distro, displayname=distro)
    ...     distroseries = factory.makeDistroRelease(
    ...         name=series, distribution=distro)
    ...     sourcepackagename = factory.makeSourcePackageName(name=name)
    ...     return SourcePackage(sourcepackagename, distroseries)

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> source_package = make_source_package('distro', 'series', 'foo')
    >>> source_package_url = canonical_url(source_package, rootsite='code')
    >>> logout()

This takes us to the branch listing for that source package

    >>> browser.open(source_package_url)
    >>> print browser.title
    Branches of foo in distro series

Since there are no branches, there is no branch listing table:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branchtable')
    None

    >>> print_tag_with_id(browser.contents, 'branch-summary')
    There are no branches of foo in distro series in Launchpad.

Listings of distribution source packages also just show a message.

    >>> browser.open("http://code.launchpad.dev/distro/+source/foo")
    >>> print repr(browser.title)
    'Branches for the \xe2\x80\x9cfoo\xe2\x80\x9d package in distro'

Since there are no branches, there is no branch listing table:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branchtable')
    None

    >>> print repr(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branch-summary')))
    u'There are no branches for the \u201cfoo\u201d package
    in distro in Launchpad.'
