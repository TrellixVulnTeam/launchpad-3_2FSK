    <div tal:content="context/description">This is the Project Description,
    which is a much more substantial description of the project. It should
    be several paragraphs long, and give you a very clear insight into the
    work of the Project, and the people behind it. It should describe the
    project history, and organisation.
    
    The Project Description should also mention the major product or
    products from that project. For example, the Apache Project description
    would highlight its work on the Apache Server, and mention other
    products such as APR.</div>
