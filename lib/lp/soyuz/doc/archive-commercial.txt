Commercial PPAs
===============

Commercial PPAs are to all intents and purposes identical to private PPAs.
They contain a 'commercial' flag which indicates that the PPA is actively
selling software and should be more discoverable.

Lets start by making a private PPA for demonstration purposes:

    >>> ppa = factory.makeArchive(private=True, name="pppa")

IArchive.getCommercialPPAs() retrieves the subset of all private PPAs that are
marked for commercial usage.

    >>> for commercial_ppa in archive_set.getCommercialPPAs():
    ...     print commercial_ppa.name

There are none yet - if we mark "ppa" as commercial it will be
returned:

    >>> # Setting 'commercial' is restricted to admins but we don't want to
    >>> # worry about that here.
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(ppa).commercial = True
    >>> for commercial_ppa in archive_set.getCommercialPPAs():
    ...     print commercial_ppa.name
    pppa
