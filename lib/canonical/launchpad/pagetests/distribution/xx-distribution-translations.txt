This page shows a list of PO templates contained within all source packages
for the distrorelease that is the translation focus for a given distribution.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/ubuntu/+translations')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/ubuntu/+translations'

Check that there aren't disabled languages shown here:

  >>> 'Spanish (Spain)' not in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Italian (Italy)' not in browser.contents
  True

But we show the other languages

  >>> 'Spanish' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Italian' in browser.contents
  True

Portuguese (Brazil) is a country specific language but it should not be
disabled and appear in our list.

  >>> 'Portuguese (Brazil)' in browser.contents
  True

Now, we are going to check that the language list we got is pointing to the
right translation focus.

  >>> browser.getLink('Spanish')
  <Link text='Spanish' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/hoary/+lang/es'>
  >>> browser.getLink('Italian')
  <Link text='Italian' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/hoary/+lang/it'>
  >>> browser.getLink('Portuguese (Brazil)')
  <Link text='Portuguese (Brazil)' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/hoary/+lang/pt_BR'>

And the other Ubuntu distributions should be there too.

  >>> 'Other releases of Ubuntu' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Breezy Badger Autotest' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'The Grumpy Groundhog Release' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'The Warty Warthog Release' in browser.contents
  True

We are not showing its translation status here, so we should have links to
their particular translation status.

  >>> browser.getLink('6.6.6 Breezy Badger Autotest')
  <Link text='6.6.6 Breezy Badger Autotest' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/breezy-autotest/+translations'>
  >>> browser.getLink('5.10 The Grumpy Groundhog Release')
  <Link text='5.10 The Grumpy Groundhog Release' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/grumpy/+translations'>
  >>> browser.getLink('4.10 The Warty Warthog Release')
  <Link text='4.10 The Warty Warthog Release' url='http://localhost/ubuntu/warty/+translations'>

But we are already showing the status for the translation focus one,
we should not have a link to it.

  >>> 'http://localhost/ubuntu/hoary/+translations' in browser.contents
  False

Let's try now a distribution that lacks a translation focus.
Debian is a good example. We should get latest release as the translation focus.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/debian/+translations')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/debian/+translations'

It doesn't have any translation, so we will get the defaul geoIP languages
pointing to the latest release, Hoary.

  >>> browser.getLink('Zulu')
  <Link text='Zulu' url='http://localhost/debian/sarge/+lang/zu'>

And the other Ubuntu distributions should be there too.

  >>> 'Other releases of Debian' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Sid' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'WOODY' in browser.contents
  True

We are not showing its translation status here, so we should have links to
their particular translation status.

  >>> browser.getLink('3.2 Sid')
  <Link text='3.2 Sid' url='http://localhost/debian/sid/+translations'>
  >>> browser.getLink('3.0 WOODY')
  <Link text='3.0 WOODY' url='http://localhost/debian/woody/+translations'>

But we are already showing the status for the translation focus one,
we should not have a link to it.

  >>> 'http://localhost/debian/sarge/+translations' in browser.contents
  False
