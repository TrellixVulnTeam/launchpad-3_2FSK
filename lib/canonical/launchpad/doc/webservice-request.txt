Most of the time, web service requests come through the web service
layer. But there are times when a request that came through the
website neeeds to be treated as a web service request. It's easy to
adapt a normal request into an IWebServiceLayer request.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from canonical.lazr.interfaces.rest import WebServiceLayer

    >>> website_request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     SERVER_URL="http://launchpad.dev/")
    >>> request = WebServiceLayer(website_request)
    >>> request
    <canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers.WebServiceClientRequest ...>
    >>> request.getApplicationURL()
    'http://launchpad.dev/api/beta'

This works for HTTPS requests as well as HTTP requests:

    >>> website_request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     SERVER_URL="https://launchpad.dev/")
    >>> request = WebServiceLayer(website_request)
    >>> request
    <canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers.WebServiceClientRequest ...>
    >>> request.getApplicationURL()
    'https://launchpad.dev/api/beta'
