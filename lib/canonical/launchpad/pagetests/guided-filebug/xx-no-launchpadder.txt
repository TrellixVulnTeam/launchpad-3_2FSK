We do some special-handling of the cases where upstream doesn't use
Launchpad as their official bugtracker. In this situation, we want to tell
people what their options are. 

=== Upstreams ===

Alsa-utils, for instance, doesn't use Launchpad Bugs:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/alsa-utils/+filebug')
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'warning'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    alsa-utils does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.
 
But it's packaged in Ubuntu and Debian, and we suggest those packages
for filing bugs:

    >>> user_browser.getLink("Ubuntu alsa-utils") is not None
    True

We don't know what bug tracker they use either:

    >>> "doesn't know what bug tracker" in user_browser.contents
    True
    >>> user_browser.getLink("Tell us about it.") is not None
    True

Gnomebaker doesn't use Launchpad Bugs either. We don't have packaging
information for it:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/gnomebaker/+filebug')
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'warning'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    gnomebaker does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.
    >>> user_browser.getLink("linking them for us.") is not None
    True

But we do know what tracker it uses:

    >>> user_browser.getLink("GnomeGBug GTracker") is not None
    True


== Advanced Filebug ==

The same happens with the advanced filebug form:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/+filebug-advanced")
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'warning'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    alsa-utils does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.

=== Distros ===

Distributions have less options available if they don't use Launchpad:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/debian/+filebug')
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Debian does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.

They get the same messages in the advanced filebug page:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/distros/debian/+filebug-advanced")
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Debian does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.

=== Distro Source Packages ===

It's also not possible to file a bug on any of the distribution's
source package.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/"
    ...     "+filebug")
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Debian does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.

Not even using the advanced filebug page:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/distros/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/"
    ...     "+filebug-advanced")
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Debian does not use Launchpad as its bug tracker.
