AUTOMATIC ADD/EDIT FORM MACHINERY

In order that we get a consistent look and feel of the automatically
generated forms in Launchpad, please use the following process for
any new add/edit forms where you are using the automatic machinery:

 1. cp launchpad-addform.pt table-add.pt
 2. tla add table-add.py
 3. vi zcml/table.pt and add the relevant <browser:addform or
    <browser:editform section.

     - make sure you set a label="The Form Title"
     - template="../templates/table-add.pt"
 
 4. customise table-add.pt or table-edit.pt with appropriate text.

ROCK ON!

Please update this file as appropriate, let Mark, Steve and Stub know
of any changes you have made to the process.
