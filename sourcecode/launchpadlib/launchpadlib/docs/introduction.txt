launchpadlib is the standalone Python language bindings to Launchpad's web
services API.  It is officially supported by Canonical, although third party
packages may be available to provide bindings to other programming languages.

launchpadlib is currently in pre-alpha release.

    >>> import launchpadlib
    >>> launchpadlib.__version__
    '0.1'

launchpadlib talks to Launchpad's API facet, but anonymous users are not
allowed to access even the root service.

    >>> from urllib import urlopen
    >>> import lxml.objectify
    >>> def parse(url):
    ...     connection = urlopen(url)
    ...     try:
    ...         tree = lxml.objectify.parse(connection)
    ...     finally:
    ...         connection.close()
    ...     return tree.getroot()

    >>> root = parse('http://api.launchpad.dev')
    >>> root.head.title
    'Forbidden'
    >>> root.body.div[1].table.tr.td.div.text.strip()
    u'Not logged in \u2014'

Anonymous users cannot even access the beta service.

    >>> root = parse('http://api.launchpad.dev/beta')
    >>> root.head.title
    'Forbidden'
    >>> root.body.div[1].table.tr.td.div.text.strip()
    u'Not logged in \u2014'
