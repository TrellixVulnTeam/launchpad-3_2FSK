= Teams with Private Membership =

If a team's visibility attribute is set to Private Membership, only
launchpad admins and members of that team can see the membership.

Create a test team with private membership and a test member. Even
though no-priv is a proposed member by requesting to join this moderated
team, he still does not get access to the membership list.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup as Soup
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IPersonSet, PersonCreationRationale, PersonVisibility)
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> member, email = person_set.createPersonAndEmail(
    ...     'member@canonical.com', PersonCreationRationale.UNKNOWN,
    ...     name='member', displayname="Gold Member", password='test')
    >>> member.setPreferredEmail(email)
    >>> team_owner, email = person_set.createPersonAndEmail(
    ...     'owner@canonical.com', PersonCreationRationale.UNKNOWN,
    ...     name='owner', displayname="Owner", password='test')
    >>> team_owner.setPreferredEmail(email)

    >>> team.addMember(member, team_owner)
    >>> other_team = person_set.newTeam(team_owner, 'otherteam', 'Other Team')
    >>> other_team.addMember(team_owner, team_owner)

    >>> def print_members(contents, type):
    ...     table = find_tag_by_id(contents, type)
    ...     for link in table.findAll('a'):
    ...         if link.renderContents() != 'Edit' and not link.find('img'):
    ...             print link.renderContents()


== Membership Page ==

This +members page will raise an exception for unauthorized users.

    >>> nopriv_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myteam/+members')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

The +members page is visible for someone on the team.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic member@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myteam/+members')
    >>> print_members(browser.contents, 'activemembers')
    Gold Member
    Owner
    >>> print_members(browser.contents, 'proposedmembers')
    No Privileges Person

== Team Page ==

An unauthorized user cannot see the recently approved members,
recently applied members, or the membership summary on the ~myteam page.

    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myteam')
    >>> soup = Soup(nopriv_browser.contents)
    >>> soup.find('div', id='recently-approved')
    >>> soup.find('div', id='recently-applied')
    >>> soup.find('table', id='membership-summary')
    <...You are not allowed to view this team's membership...

A team member will be able to see these parts of the team page.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myteam')
    >>> soup = Soup(browser.contents)
    >>> soup.find('div', id='recently-approved')
    <...<a href="/~member">Gold Member (member)</a>...


    >>> soup.find('div', id='recently-applied')
    <...<a href="/~no-priv">No Privileges Person (no-priv)</a>...

    >>> soup.find('table', id='membership-summary')
    <...2 active members...1 proposed members...

== Team Participation ==

On the person page, it will show which teams they belong to. Although, it
would be time consuming to gather the entire team membership, we don't want
to leak this information, so MyTeam which has a private membership won't
show up below.

    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~owner')
    >>> soup = Soup(nopriv_browser.contents)
    >>> a_tags = soup.find('table', id='participation').findAll('a')
    >>> for a_tag in a_tags:
    ...     print a_tag.contents
    [u'Other Team']

Another member of MyTeam can see that name16 (Foo Bar) participates in
MyTeam.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~owner')
    >>> soup = Soup(browser.contents)
    >>> a_tags = soup.find('table', id='participation').findAll('a')
    >>> for a_tag in a_tags:
    ...     print a_tag.contents
    [u'My Team']
    [u'Other Team']


== Teams with Icons ==

The person page also shows a list of icons for all the teams that have
custom icons that the person belongs to. We need to filter out teams
with private membership.

First, we will add a custom icon to two teams.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import set_branding
    >>> admin_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic mark@hbd.com:test')
    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myteam/+branding')
    >>> set_branding(admin_browser)
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Branding').click()

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~otherteam/+branding')
    >>> set_branding(admin_browser)
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Branding').click()

The user which is not on myteam will only see otherteam listed.

    >>> nopriv_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~owner')
    >>> soup = Soup(nopriv_browser.contents)
    >>> for a_tag in soup.find('div', id='teams_with_icons').findAll('a'):
    ...     print a_tag['href']
    /~otherteam


Another team member will see both the icons for otherteam and myteam.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~owner')
    >>> soup = Soup(browser.contents)
    >>> for a_tag in soup.find('div', id='teams_with_icons').findAll('a'):
    ...     print a_tag['href']
    /~myteam
    /~otherteam


== Restrict Answer Contact ==

To prevent leaking information about a team's private membership, do not
let that team be added as an answer contact for a project.

Even the owner of the team with private membership should not see
MyTeam as an option in the form.

    >>> owner_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic owner@canonical.com:test')
    >>> owner_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+answer-contact')
    >>> soup = Soup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> team_div = soup.find('div', id='answer-contact-teams')
    >>> for label in team_div.findAll('label'):
    ...     print label.contents[1]
    &nbsp;Other Team


== Restrict Private Membership Team as SubTeam ==

To prevent leaking information about a team's private membership, do not
let that team be added as a member of a public team.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~simple-team/+addmember')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('New member').value = 'myteam'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Add Member').click()

    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...Constraint not satisfied...'

== Restrict Subscribing to Bugs ==

let that team be subscribed to a bug.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1/+addsubscriber')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Person').value = 'myteam'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Add').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1/+addsubscriber'
    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...Constraint not satisfied...'

== Restrict Subscribing to Blueprints ==

let that team be subscribed to a blueprint.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://blueprints.launchpad.dev'
    ...                    '/firefox/+spec/canvas/+addsubscriber')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Subscriber').value = 'myteam'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/firefox/+spec/canvas/+addsubscriber'
    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...Constraint not satisfied...'

== Restrict Appointing a Translator ==

To prevent leaking information about a team's private membership, do not
let that team become a translator.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev'
    ...                    '/+groups/testing-translation-team/+appoint')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Language').value = ['de']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Translator').value = 'myteam'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Add').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://translations.launchpad.dev/+groups/testing-translation-team/+appoint'
    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...Constraint not satisfied...'

== Restrict Project Owner ==

To prevent leaking information about a team's private membership, do not
let that team be the owner of a project.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/mozilla/+reassign')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name='field.owner').value = 'myteam'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Registrant').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/mozilla/+reassign'
    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...The person/team named \'myteam\' is not a valid owner for...'

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Registrant').click()

    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...The person/team named \'myteam\' is not a valid owner for...'

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Registrant').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+reassign'
    >>> admin_browser.contents
    '...The person/team named \'myteam\' is not a valid owner for...'
