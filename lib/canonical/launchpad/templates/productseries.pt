    <h1>Series overview</h1>

    <p class="documentDescription">
      A "release series" or "branch" is a sequence of releases (and of
      course a revision control branch from which they are made) that are
      mostly the same codebase, with just minor changes between them.
    </p>

    <p>This release series is summarised as:</p>

    <p tal:content="structure context/summary/fmt:text-to-html">
        $ProductSeries.summary goes here. This should be quite short,
        just a single paragraph of text really, giving the status of
        this series of releases.
    </p>

    <h2>This branch in the Bazaar</h2>
