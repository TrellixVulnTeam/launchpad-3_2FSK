Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with %(import_title)s to Launchpad.

The file could not be imported because of text encoding problems.  This may indicate that the file does not specify the correct encoding, or that it contains garbled or truncated text data.

The specific error message was:
