= Build Record UI =


Relevant build details are listed in the page body.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> build_details = extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'build-details'))

The print_text function is required to present the contents
of builf 9 page after it is filtered by 'extract_text', a simple
'print' results in a UnicodeDecodeError. Note that the usual procedure
works fine for build 10 (see below in 'Builds created by Gina' section).
See further information about this issue in bug #69988.

    >>> def print_text(text):
    ...     print str(text)

    >>> print_text(build_details)

'Upload log' is only mentioned when it contains a reference to a
library file and it only happens for FAILEDTOUPLOAD builds.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/22")
    >>> build_details = extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'build-details'))

Let's also check a successfully built record.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/30")
    >>> build_details = extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'build-details'))
    >>> print_text(build_details)
    Changes file: not available

Build records contain a portlet listing the resulting binaries.

    >>> binary_portlet = extract_text(
    ...     find_portlet(anon_browser.contents, 'Resulting binaries'))
    >>> print_text(binary_portlet)
    Resulting binaries
    mozilla-firefox 0.9

Each listed binary links to the corresponding page.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink("mozilla-firefox 0.9").url
    'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/hppa/mozilla-firefox/0.9'

The user can see the estimated build start time field for each job
still in the build queue.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/11")
    >>> build_details = extract_text(

== Build Retrying ==

In order to test build retrying action we have to make ubuntu/warty
active for development.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, DistroSeriesStatus)
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> warty.status = DistroSeriesStatus.DEVELOPMENT
    >>> logout()
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

With anonymous access, Retry Build link should not be there.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> anon_browser.getLink("Retry build")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

Even if accessed with a manually typed URL it will result in a error.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9/+retry")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Users who have upload permissions for the respective distribution
(but are not a member of an admin team) are allowed to retry the build.

    >>> uploader_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth='Basic jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com:jdub')
    >>> uploader_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> uploader_browser.getLink("Retry build").click()

An unprivileged user (not a member of any team) has no access to the
rebuild link however.

    >>> noteam_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic no-team-memberships@test.com:test")
    >>> noteam_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> noteam_browser.getLink("Retry build")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

If we grant the unprivileged user upload permissions for the specific
source package, however, the build retry link becomes avaialable.

Let's grant the package specific upload permissions first.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     ArchivePermissionType, IPersonSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ArchivePermission
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> noteam_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail(
    ...     'no-team-memberships@test.com')
    >>> pmount_name = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)['pmount']
    >>> discard = ArchivePermission(
    ...     archive=ubuntu.main_archive, person=noteam_person,
    ...     permission=ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD,
    ...     sourcepackagename=pmount_name, component=None)
    >>> logout()
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now even the unprivileged user (not a member of any team) will have
access to the rebuild link.

    >>> noteam_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> noteam_browser.getLink("Retry build").click()

When the user has permission (buildd-admin, admin or the source
uploader) the link to 'retry' the build is presented in the Action
menu.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> admin_browser.getLink("Retry build").click()

The 'Retry Build' page contains a message explaining the consequences
of this procedure.

    >>> print_text(
    ...     extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents)))
    Retry i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    The status of i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    is Failed to build.
    Retrying this build will destroy its history and logs.
    Are you sure ?

We'll also set up a second browser pointing at this page, for later.
XXX: waiting for bug #68655's cloneBrowser function.

    >>> admin_browser_2 = setupBrowser(auth="Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test")
    >>> admin_browser_2.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/9")
    >>> admin_browser_2.getLink("Retry build").click()

Performing "Retry Build" with the first browser

    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Retry Build").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    [u'Build record active']

Now it's active again, the retry button and the link to the retry page
are gone.

    >>> admin_browser.getLink("Retry build")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

The second browser has old content, so still has a retry build button.
Clicking this should give a warning.

    >>> admin_browser_2.getControl("Retry Build").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(admin_browser_2.contents)
    [u'Build can not be retried']


== Build Rescoring ==

Build rescoring feature (fixed bug #44227, we create build records
when retrying a build, so there is no life-cycle for a pending build
without buildqueue record anymore.)

    >>> admin_browser.getLink("Rescore build").click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value = '100'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Update").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    [u'Build Record rescored to 100']

It checks input data sanity (bug # 44240).

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value = 'foo'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Update").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    [u'priority must be an integer not "foo"']

And also handles direct attempts to rescore a build in the wrong
state.

    >>> print http(r"""
    ... POST /ubuntu/+source/netapplet/0.99.6-1/+build/13/+rescore HTTP/1.1
    ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
    ... Content-Length: 9
    ...
    ... RESCORE=6""")
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Content-Length: ...
    ...i386 build of netapplet 0.99.6-1 in ubuntu warty...
    ...Build can not be rescored...


== Builds created by Gina ==

Gina, when importing packages from debian, is allowed to create build
records to satisfy our DB model, however we don't populate most of the
fields because they would not be accurate.

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/10")
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'build-details'))
    Changes file: not available
    Archive: ubuntu archive
    Component: main
    Status: Successfully built
    Queued: 2006-01-27
    Started: not available
    Builder: not available
    Build log: not available
    Finished: not available


== Buildd Admins ==

Check if buildd-celebrity is working as expected, try to access protected
pages as cprov (launchpad-buildd-admins member). Not using the better login
method here, as don't know the password.

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...       auth='Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:cprov')
    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+build/12")
    >>> cprov_browser.getLink("Retry build").click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl("Retry Build").click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(cprov_browser.contents))
    Retry i386 build of libstdc++ b8p in ubuntu hoary RELEASE
    Build record active

Allow Re-score:

    >>> cprov_browser.getLink("Rescore build").click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value = '100'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl("Update").click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(cprov_browser.contents))
    Rescore i386 build of libstdc++ b8p in ubuntu hoary RELEASE
    Build Record rescored to 100
    ...


=== Dealing with Builders ===

Only buildd-celebrities are allowed to add/modify builders

Adding new builder:

    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+new")

Administration of a builder:

    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/bob/+admin")

Adding new builder still denied for non-members (Edgar, no membership):

    >>> one_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic one-membership@test.com:test")
    >>> one_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+new")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

Adding a new builder is also denied for anonymous:

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+builds/+new")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...


== PPA Builds ==

While keeping the same permission scheme we have for ubuntu builds,
i.e. that admins and lp-buildd-admins can modify them, PPA builds
also grant those rights to the PPA owner.

'anonymous' and 'normal users' (i.e. authenticated users not related to
the archive) are not allowed to modify the build record.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Retry build')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> one_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> one_browser.getLink('Retry build')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> one_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24/+retry")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24/+retry")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ..., 'browserDefault', 'launchpad.Edit')

Ensure 'admins' and 'lp-buildd-admins' (foo.bar is a member of
lp-buildd-admins) have access for retrying PPA build.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> print_action_links(admin_browser.contents)
    View PPA: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive
    View build records: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/+builds
    Retry build: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/+build/24/+retry
    Rescore build (disabled)

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> print_action_links(user_browser.contents)
    View PPA: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive
    View build records: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/+builds
    Retry build: http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/+build/24/+retry
    Rescore build (disabled)

PPA build pages also have some text telling the viewer that they can retry
the build if that action is possible:

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents))
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    You can retry this build if you think
    the failure was transient. Be aware that the previous
    build log and timestamps will be purged.
    ...

PPA owner can 'retry' a build.

    >>> no_priv_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test")
    >>> no_priv_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> no_priv_browser.getLink('Retry build').click()
    >>> no_priv_browser.getControl("Retry Build").click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(no_priv_browser.contents))
    Retry i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    Build record active

PPA owner may not re-score the build record. They could heavily mess
with the PPA build ordering by having the ability to assign *any*
enormous score value.

    >>> no_priv_browser.getLink("Rescore build").click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

'admins' and 'lp-build-admins' are the only entities able to
re-score PPA jobs:

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Rescore build').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value
    '0'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value = '100'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Update").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    [u'Build Record rescored to 100']

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...    "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/cdrkit/1.0/+build/24")
    >>> cprov_browser.getLink('Rescore build').click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value
    '100'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name="SCORE").value = '200'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl("Update").click()
    >>> get_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents)
    [u'Build Record rescored to 200']
