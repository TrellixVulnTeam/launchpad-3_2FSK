Hello,

There was a problem with translations branch synchronization for
%(productseries)s.

Branch synchronization for this release series has been set up to commit
translations snapshots to the bzr branch at %(branch_url)s.

That branch does not appear to have been pushed to Launchpad yet.
Please create a branch on your own system that matches your needs, and
then push it to Launchpad using "bzr push %(branch_url)s".

You'll need the bzr tool.  If all you want is an empty branch for the
translations to go into, you can create one using the following command
lines:

    bzr launchpad-login USERNAME

Instead of USERNAME, type your Launchpad login name.  Then:

    bzr init translations-export
    cd translations-export
    bzr commit --unchanged -m "Translations branch."
    bzr push %(branch_url)s

This will create an empty branch on Launchpad.  It should be updated
with translations within the day.  You can update the branch on your
system with the latest changes on Launchpad by going back into the
translations-export directory and typing this command:

    bzr pull --remember %(branch_url)s
