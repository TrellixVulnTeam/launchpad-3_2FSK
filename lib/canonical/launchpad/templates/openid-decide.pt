            is your identity URL.

        <p>If you click the <strong>Allow Once</strong> button, we will

            that <tal:x content="view/openid_request/identity" />
            belongs to you.

        <p>If you click the <strong>Deny</strong> button, we will send you
            back to <tal:x content="view/openid_request/trust_root" />
            without confirming your identity.
