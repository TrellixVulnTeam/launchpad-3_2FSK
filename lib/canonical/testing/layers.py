"""Layers used by Canonical tests.

Layers are the mechanism used by the Zope3 test runner to efficiently
provide environments for tests and are documented in the lib/zope/testing.

Note that every Layer should define all of setUp, tearDown, testSetUp
and testTearDown. If you don't do this, a base class' method will be called
instead probably breaking something.

TODO: Make the Zope3 test runner handle multiple layers per test instead
of one, forcing us to attempt to make some sort of layer tree.
