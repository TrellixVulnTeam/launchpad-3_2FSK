    <h5 id="q1">How do I get translations in and out of Launchpad? </h5>
    <p>Launchpad supports standard GNU ?GetText files. To import existing
       translations, simply upload your .po files. When you're to export your
       translations, Launchpad will generate .po or .mo files.

    <h5 id="q2">How can people help translate my software?</h5>
    <p>Anyone can help translate your software: all they need is a web browser
       and a free Launchpad account. To help organise and communicate with
       your translators you can set up translation teams and groups.
    </p>
    <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h5 id="q3">Which languages does Launchpad support?</h5>
    <p>Launchpad already supports hundreds of languages and you can add any
       other language that has an ISO 639 code (e.g. "en", "fr, "cy").

    <h5 id="q4">How does Launchpad automatically suggest translations for my
                software?</h5>
    <p>Similar text appears in all software. With more than 18,000 translators
       working in almost 250 languages, all the most common strings have
       already been translated. Launchpad checks translations in other
       software to see if any of your strings have already been translated,
       giving your localisation a head-start.
    </p>
    <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h5 id="q5">How can I maintain the quality of translations?</h5>
    <p>Most projects prefer to allow anyone to make a translation, while
       tasking trusted team members with quality control. Alternatively, you
       can choose to accept translations only from approved translators.
    </p>

    <h5 id="q6">How do I start using Launchpad for my project?</h5>
    <p>Register your software in Launchpad, then upload your .pot translation
       template files. You can find out more in our guide <a href="">Translating
         your software using Launchpad</a>. Contact the Launchpad team to
       request official translation status.
    </p>

    <h5 id="q7">How do I mark my project as an official Launchpad Translations
                user?</h5>
    <p>Contact the Launchpad team using the Answers Tracker. Marking your
       project as an official Translations user helps translators to see that
       their work will be used.
    </p>
    <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h5 id="q8">Will translations from my software be suggested to other
                projects?</h5>
    <p>Yes. Launchpad is designed to help open source software projects work
       together. Suggested translations help the localisation of open source
       software to take place far quicker than would otherwise be possible.
    </p>

    <h5 id="q9">Can I use suggested translations from projects that use a
                licence that is incompatible with my software?</h5>
    <p>Yes. We ask that all translations submitted through Launchpad use the
       BSD licence. This makes the strings available to the widest number of
       open source projects.
