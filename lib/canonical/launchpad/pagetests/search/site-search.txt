= Site-wide Search =

Launchpad features a site-wide search that combines Google's
site-specific search with our own searches for specific items (bugs,
teams, etc.).

    # Our very helpful function for printing all the page results.
    >>> def print_search_results():
    ...     tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'search-results')
    ...     if tag:
    ...         print extract_text(tag)

    # Another helper to make searching convenient
    >>> def search_for(terms):
    ...     search_text = browser.getControl(name='field.search_text')
    ...     search_text.value = terms
    ...     browser.getControl(name='field.actions.search').click()

The search is accessible via the root +search url:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+search')
    >>> print browser.title
    Search Launchpad

No search results are shown on the basic page:

    >>> print_search_results()

A search for a specific item, such as a project name, will return a
result for that exact match in Launchpad.

    >>> search_for('firefox')
    >>> print browser.title
    Pages matching "firefox" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Most relavent matches
    Mozilla Firefox
    The Mozilla Firefox web browser

Searching for an integer will return the matching bug number as well
as the matching question number, if one exists.

    >>> search_for('3')
    >>> print browser.title
    Pages matching "3" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Most relavent matches
    Bug #3: Bug Title Test
    ...
    3: Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM
    ...

An arbitrary search returns a list of Google search results.

    # Use our pre-defined search results for the 'bug' search.
    >>> search_for('bug')
    >>> print browser.title
    Pages matching "bug" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Matching pages
    1 &rarr; 20 of 25 results...
    Launchpad Bugs...
    Bugs in Ubuntu Linux...
    Bugs related to Sample Person...
    Bug #1 in Mozilla Firefox: ...Firefox does not support SVG...
    ...

The search can only return twenty results per-page.  Additional
matches are shown on subsequent pages.

    >>> first_page_results = list(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'pagematch'))
    >>> len(first_page_results)
    20

As per the standard batch navigator, clicking on the 'Next' link
takes you to the next page of results.

    >>> browser.getLink('Next').click()
    >>> second_page_results = list(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'pagematch'))
    >>> len(second_page_results)
    5

    >>> in_both = [m for m in second_page_results
    ...            if m in first_page_results]
    >>> in_both
    []

teams, or projects, will return their respective matching item.

== Searches with no results ==

Searches that don't return any results display a kind message to the user.

    >>> search_for('fnord')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
    Search Launchpad:
    ...
    Your search, &ldquo;fnord&rdquo;, did not return any results.


== Searches for the empty string ==

Leaving the search field empty returns the original search
 page, with
no results, as if the user had not yet performed a search.

    >>> search_for('')
    >>> print browser.title
    Search Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
