= Translation Export Request Queue =

The queue of export requests is served by a cron script. Let's check if it can
serve those requests properly.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.poexportrequest import (
    ...     IPOExportRequestSet)
    >>> from lp.translations.utilities.tests.helpers import (
    ...     is_valid_mofile)

This is a dummy logger class to capture the export's log messages.

    >>> import sys
    >>> import traceback

    >>> class MockLogger:
    ...     messages = []
    ...
    ...     def log(self, *stuff, **kw):
    ...         print 'log>', ' '.join(stuff)
    ...
    ...         if 'exc_info' in kw:
    ...             exception = traceback.format_exception(*sys.exc_info())
    ...             for thing in exception:
    ...                 for line in thing.splitlines():
    ...                     self.log(line)
    ...
    ...     debug = info = warn = error = log
    ...
    ...     def exception(self, *stuff):
    ...         self.log(*stuff, **{'exc_info': True})

Here's somebody to make a request.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.person import Person
    >>> person = Person.get(1)


== Requesting PO files ==

Our user requests the Catalan and Czech translations of a template.

    >>> from lp.translations.model.potemplate import POTemplate
    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(2)
    >>> ca = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('ca')
    >>> cs = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('cs')

    >>> request_set = getUtility(IPOExportRequestSet)
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Now we request that the queue be processed.

    >>> class MockTransactionManager:
    ...     def commit(self):
    ...         pass

    >>> from lp.translations.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue
    >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
    log> Exporting objects for Mark Shuttleworth, related to template pmount
    in Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"
    log> Stored file at http://.../launchpad-export.tar.gz

We need to make sure the Librarian data has settled into place.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

The user receives a confirmation email.

    >>> def print_mail_body(body):
    ...     lines = body[body.index('\n\n')+2:].split('\n')
    ...     for line in lines:
    ...         print ">", line

    >>> from lp.services.mail.stub import test_emails
    >>> len(test_emails)
    1
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
    >>> to_addrs
    ['mark@example.com']
    >>> print_mail_body(body)
    >
    > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    >
    > The translation files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
    > download from the following location:
    >
    >     http://localhost:58000/.../launchpad-export.tar.gz

The email contains a URL linking to where the exported file can be downloaded.

    >>> import re

    >>> def extract_url(text):
    ...     urls = re.compile(r'^ *(http://.*)$', re.M).findall(text)
    ...     return urls[0]

    >>> url = extract_url(body)

Let's download it and make sure the contents look ok.

    >>> import urllib2
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import string_to_tarfile
    >>> tarball = string_to_tarfile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> for name in sorted(tarball.getnames()):
    ...   print name
    pmount/
    pmount/pmount-ca.po
    pmount/pmount-cs.po


== Duplicate requests ==

On another occasion, the user requests just Catalan translation.  The
queue is initially empty.

    >>> def render_request(request):
    ...     if request.pofile is None:
    ...         return request.potemplate.name
    ...     else:
    ...         return "%s:%s" % (request.potemplate.name,
    ...                           request.pofile.language.code)
    >>> from lp.translations.model.poexportrequest import (
    ...     POExportRequest)
    >>> def print_queue():
    ...     requests = [
    ...         render_request(request)
    ...         for request in POExportRequest.select()]
    ...     for request in sorted(requests):
    ...         print request
    >>> print_queue()

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca])

The request is on the queue, as you'd expect.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount:ca

The same user now makes a separate, new request for the Catalan and
Czech translations.

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Since the request for the Catalan translation is a duplicate, only the
Czech one is added to the export queue.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs

The user also requests the template again.

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, potemplate)
    >>> print_queue()
    pmount
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs

The user now requests all of these files again, as well as the Spanish
translation.

    >>> es = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, potemplate, [ca, cs, es])

Most of this request consists of duplications, and those are ignored.
Only the Spanish request is new, and that goes into the queue.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs
    pmount:es

    >>> # Clean up the queue again.
    >>> for request in POExportRequest.select():
    ...     request.destroySelf()


== Requesting MO files ==

Let's try requesting an export in MO format:

    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationfileformat import (
    ...     TranslationFileFormat)
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [cs], TranslationFileFormat.MO)
    >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
    log> Exporting objects for Mark Shuttleworth, related to template pmount
    in Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"
    log> Stored file at http://.../cs_LC_MESSAGES_pmount.mo

    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> len(test_emails)
    1
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
    >>> to_addrs
    ['mark@example.com']
    >>> print_mail_body(body)
    > 
    > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    > 
    > The translation files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
    > download from the following location:
    > 
    >     http://localhost:58000/.../cs_LC_MESSAGES_pmount.mo
    >>> url = extract_url(body)

Check whether we generated a good .mo file.

    >>> is_valid_mofile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    True


== Cron script ==

Finally, the code should work when executed from the script. This is a good
way that the user used by the script has the needed rights to use the
database.

The queue can contain requests for translations from both distributions and
products.  Each request may request a template, or a list of templates, or
just PO files.

    # We need to request again some files.
    >>> ca.potemplate.distroseries is None
    False
    >>> cs.potemplate.distroseries is None
    False
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])
    >>> product_template = potemplate.get(1)
    >>> product_template.productseries is None
    False
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, product_template)
    >>> alsa_template = POTemplate.selectOneBy(path='po/alsa-utils.pot')
    >>> alsa_es = alsa_template.getPOFileByLang('es')
    >>> netapplet_template = POTemplate.selectOneBy(path='po/netapplet.pot')
    >>> request_set.addRequest(
    ...     person, [alsa_template, netapplet_template], [alsa_es])
    >>> transaction.commit()

The script is run.

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
    ...     sys.executable, 'cronscripts/rosetta-export-queue.py', '-vv'
    ...     ], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
    ...     )
    >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
    >>> print output
