  <p>The branch visibility policy is used to define the default visibility
  of branches when they are created.</p>

  <p>Both projects and products can define a branch visibility policy.  If a
  policy does not exist for a product, it uses the policy defined by its
  project (if it exists).</p>

  <p>There is an implicit policy defined for both products and projects.
  The implicit policy is that everyone can create public branches.
  In order to override this implicit policy you need to explicitly
  define a policy for everyone, and this is done by
  not specifying a team when adding a new policy.</p>
