= Updating personal standing =

People have a personal standing which controls whether their postings to
mailing lists they are not members require moderation or not.  Personal
standing can be set explicitly by a Launchpad administrator, but it can
also be calculated by a cron script from the history of reviewed and
approved messages.  If a person posts a message to a mailing list they
are not a member of, their message gets held for moderator approval.

    ...     IPersonSet, PersonalStanding)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import sync, syncUpdate

    >>> lifeless = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('lifeless')
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing_reason = ''

After one approval, Robert's standing does not change.

    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-one')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

Even after three approvals, if the message was posted to the same list,
Robert's personal standing does not change.

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-one')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-one')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

Robert needs to get some approvals from a few more mailing lists before
his personal standing can be updated.

    >>> team_two, list_two = mailinglists_helper.new_team('test-two', True)
    >>> team_three, list_three = mailinglists_helper.new_team(
    ...     'test-three', True)

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-two')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

Rejected and discarded messages don't count.

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-three')
    >>> message.reject(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-three')
    >>> message.discard(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

Neither do approved messages from someone else.

    >>> message = post_message('carlos@canonical.com', 'test-two')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    
    >>> message = post_message('carlos@canonical.com', 'test-three')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)

    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...>

Robert's next message goes to a third mailing list, and this gets
approved.  As a result, his personal standing gets updated.

    >>> message = lifeless_post('test-three')
    >>> message.approve(foobar)
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Setting standing for lifeless to GOOD
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.GOOD...>

However, Robert's standing will only be updated if it was previously
Unknown.  A standing of Poor, Good or Excellent will not be changed by
the cron script.  The most common case of this is when a person's
standing has been set to Poor by a Launchpad administrator.  In that
case, no amount of approved messages will kick them back to Good
standing.

    >>> lifeless.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.POOR
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.POOR...>

    >>> lifeless.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.GOOD
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.GOOD...>

    >>> lifeless.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.EXCELLENT
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.EXCELLENT...>

Should Robert's standing get kicked back to Unknown, then his approved
messages will count toward his good standing again.

    >>> lifeless.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN
    >>> script.main()
    log> Analyzing approved messages
    log> Updating personal standings
    log> Setting standing for lifeless to GOOD
    log> Done.
    >>> sync(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.GOOD...>
