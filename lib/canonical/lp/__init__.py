    After calling this method, string-type columns are returned as Unicode
    and date and time columns returned as Python datetime, date and time
    instances.

    To do this, we simply call the internal psycopg adapter method that
    does this. This is ugly, but ensures that the conversions work
    identically no matter if the Zope3 environment has been loaded. This
    is particularly important for the testing framework, as the converters
    are global and not reset in the test harness tear down methods.
    It also saves a lot of typing.

    This method is invoked on module load, ensuring that any code that
    needs to access the Launchpad database has the converters installed
    (since do do this you need to access dbname and dbhost from this module).

    We cannot unittest this method, but other tests will confirm that
    the converters are working as expected.
