        been posted to your mailing list, but must be reviewed for
        appropriateness and topicality.  For each held message, you can take
        one of these actions:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approve</strong> - Accept the message, post it to the
          mailing list, and credit the original author for his or her on-topic
          posting.
          <li><strong>Decline</strong> - Reject the message, sending a bounce
          message back to the original author and giving no credit for the
          posting.  Use this action for off-topic non-spam messages.
          <li><strong>Discard</strong> - Throw the message away.  Use this
          action for obvious spam.
          <li><strong>Hold</strong> - Continue to hold the message, deferring
          your decision until later.
        </ul>
