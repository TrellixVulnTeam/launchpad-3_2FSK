= Canonical URL examples =

Here we have a bunch of examples of canonical urls of database and other
objects.

Ideally, we'd check that the URLs we have here can be accessed through the
publisher.  We'll do that later.  For now, we'll just check that the URLs
are what we expect them to be for various example objects.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import canonical_url
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)

The examples are divided into sections by theme.  Each section starts with
the imports necessary for that section, where further imports are needed.
The proceeds with an example of the IFooSet url, then its contents, and
so on.
