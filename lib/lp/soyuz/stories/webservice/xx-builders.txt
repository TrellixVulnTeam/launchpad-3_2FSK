Builders
========

The webservice exposes a top-level collection called "builders" which
contains all the registered builders in the Launchpad build farm.

    >>> launchpad = launchpadlib_for(
    ...     'builders test', 'salgado', version='devel')
    >>> builders = launchpad.builders

Iterating over the collection is possible:

    >>> for builder in builders:
    ...     print builder
    http://api.launchpad.dev/devel/builders/bob
    http://api.launchpad.dev/devel/builders/frog

An individual builder can be retrieved by name by using the getByName()
method on "builders":

    >>> bob = builders.getByName(name="bob")

Each builder has a number of properties exposed:

    >>> for attribute in bob.lp_attributes:
    ...     print attribute
    self_link
    ...
    active
    builderok
    description
    failnotes
    failure_count
    manual
    name
    title
    url
    virtualized
    vm_host
