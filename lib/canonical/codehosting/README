SFTP server for the supermirror.

It only allows SFTP (no shells), and authenticates users against keys stored in
the launchpad database (these are retrieved via the authserver).

It requires Twisted SVN r15836 or newer (note that the Twisted 2.2 release isn't
enough, even though it's newer, it doesn't include twisted.vfs).
