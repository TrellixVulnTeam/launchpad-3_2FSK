This is all a bit speculative.

Entry points
============

These are the bits of ZCML that are explicitly loaded by Python code. These
ZCML files in turn load other parts.

  site.zcml
    The big kahuna. Various config files (e.g. launchpad.conf) refer
    to this file.

  ftesting.zcml
    Used to configure the functional testing layer.  Look in
    canonical.testing.layers to see how it gets hooked in.
