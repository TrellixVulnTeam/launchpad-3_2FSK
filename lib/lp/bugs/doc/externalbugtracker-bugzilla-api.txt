Bugzilla bugtrackers with an XML-RPC API
========================================

Instances of Bugzilla version 3.4+ offer an XML-RPC API for working with
bugs. This is very similar in some regards to that offered by the
Launchpad plugin for versions 3.0 and 3.2, however the differences
between them necessitate Launchpad's support for Bugzilla 3.4+ being
implemented as a separate ExternalBugTracker.

As with the BugzillaLPPlugin ExternalBugTracker, we use a special XML-RPC
transport for the purposes of testing.

    >>> from lp.bugs.externalbugtracker.bugzilla import (
    ...     BugzillaAPI)
    >>> from lp.bugs.tests.externalbugtracker import (
    ...     TestBugzillaAPIXMLRPCTransport)
    >>> test_transport = TestBugzillaAPIXMLRPCTransport(
    ...     'http://example.com/')
    >>> bugzilla = BugzillaAPI(
    ...     'http://example.com/', xmlrpc_transport=test_transport)
    >>> bugzilla.xmlrpc_transport == test_transport
    True
