= Pulling and Scanning =

First, launch the server:
  $ make run_all

Run the puller to flush all the crap sample data branches:
  $ make pull
  
Then, push a branch:
  $ bzr push bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/...

Run the puller:
  $ make pull

Build the rewrite map:
  $ make rewritemap

Run the scanner:
  $ make scan


= Issues =

 - Bunch of junk rows in DB, cause supermirror-pull to spit lots of crap.
 - 'upload' sucks, say 'hosted' instead.
 - Pushing via smartserver doesn't work if top-level directory doesn't exist.
