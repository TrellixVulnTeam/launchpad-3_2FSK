Rosetta PO Export Request Queue
-------------------------------

The queue of export requests is served by a cron script. Let's check if it can
serve those requests properly.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPOExportRequestSet

This is a dummy logger class to capture the export's log messages.

    >>> import sys
    >>> import traceback

    >>> class MockLogger:
    ...     messages = []
    ...
    ...     def log(self, *stuff, **kw):
    ...         print 'log>', ' '.join(stuff)
    ...
    ...         if 'exc_info' in kw:
    ...             exception = traceback.format_exception(*sys.exc_info())
    ...             for thing in exception:
    ...                 for line in thing.splitlines():
    ...                     self.log(line)
    ...
    ...     debug = info = warn = error = log
    ...
    ...     def exception(self, *stuff):
    ...         self.log(*stuff, **{'exc_info': True})

Here's somebody to make a request.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
  >>> person = Person.get(1)

Here's the stuff they're going to request.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplate
  >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(2)
  >>> ca = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('ca')
  >>> cs = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('cs')

And here's them making the request.

  >>> request_set = getUtility(IPOExportRequestSet)
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Now we request that the queue be processed.

  >>> class MockTransactionManager:
  ...     def commit(self):
  ...         pass

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for Mark Shuttleworth, related to template pmount in
  Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"

We need to make sure the Librarian data has settled into place.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Let's read our mail.

  >>> def print_mail_body(body):
  ...     lines = body[body.index('\n\n')+2:].split('\n')
  ...     for line in lines:
  ...         print ">", line

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail.stub import test_emails
  >>> len(test_emails)
  1
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  >>> to_addrs
  ['mark@hbd.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  > 
  > The files you requested from Rosetta are ready for download
  > from the following location:
  > 
  >     http://localhost:58000/.../launchpad-pmount.tar.gz

The mail has a URL in it.

  >>> import re

  >>> def extract_url(text):
  ...     urls = re.compile(r'^ *(http://.*)$', re.M).findall(text)
  ...     return urls[0]

  >>> url = extract_url(body)

Let's download it and make sure the contents look ok.

  >>> import urllib2
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import string_to_tarfile
  >>> tarball = string_to_tarfile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
  >>> for name in sorted(tarball.getnames()):
  ...   print name
  pmount/
  pmount/pmount-ca.po
  pmount/pmount-cs.po

Let's try requesting an export in MO format:

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TranslationFileFormat
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [cs], TranslationFileFormat.MO)
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for Mark Shuttleworth, related to template pmount in
  Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"

  >>> transaction.commit()

  >>> len(test_emails)
  1
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  >>> to_addrs
  ['mark@hbd.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  > 
  > The files you requested from Rosetta are ready for download
  > from the following location:
  > 
  >     http://localhost:58000/.../cs_LC_MESSAGES_pmount.mo
  >>> url = extract_url(body)

We will need to define a helper function.

  >>> def is_valid_mofile(mofile):
  ...     """Test whether a string is a valid MO file."""
  ...
  ...     # There are different magics for big- and little-endianness, so we
  ...     # test for both.
  ...     be_magic = '\x95\x04\x12\xde'
  ...     le_magic = ''.join(reversed(be_magic))
  ...
  ...     for magic in (be_magic, le_magic):
  ...         if mofile[:len(magic)] == magic:
  ...             return True
  ...
  ...     return False

  >>> is_valid_mofile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
  True

Finally, the code should work when executed from the script. This is a good
way that the user used by the script has the needed rights to use the
database.

To go thru all code paths, the export should have requests for distributions
and products.

  # We need to request again some files.
  >>> ca.potemplate.distroseries is None
  False
  >>> cs.potemplate.distroseries is None
  False
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])
  >>> product_template = potemplate.get(1)
  >>> product_template.productseries is None
  False
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, product_template)
  >>> transaction.commit()

And run the script.

  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import sys
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
  ...     sys.executable, 'cronscripts/rosetta-export-queue.py', '-vv'
  ...     ], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
  ...     )
  >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
  >>> print output
