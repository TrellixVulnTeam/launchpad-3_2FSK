Check that the Bazaar home page works.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/')
    >>> footer = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'application-footer')

    >>> print extract_text(footer)
    30 branches registered in
    6 projects
    3 imported branches
    2 branches associated with bug reports

The main code home page now has a subset of the project tag cloud,
with a link to the complete listing.

    >>> preview = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'project-cloud-preview')
    >>> print extract_text(preview)
    Projects with active branches
    evolution firefox gnome-terminal iso-codes landscape thunderbird
    more&#8230;

    >>> print preview.fetch('a')[-1]['href']
    /+project-cloud


== Short Listings ==

Each of the three short branch listings on the code homepage now have
an anchor that looks like "more..." that takes the user to a branch
listing view that lists all matching branches ordered appropriately
for the listing.


=== Recently registered ===

Since each anchor looks the same, the selection is done on url.

The recently registered branch listing is ordered with the most recently
registered branches first.

    >>> registered = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recently-registered')
    >>> print registered.fetch('a')[-1]['href']
    /+recently-registered-branches

    >>> browser.getLink(url='recently-registered-branches').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Recently registered branches
    >>> browser.goBack()


== Recently changed ==

Recently changed branches are ordered with the branches with the most
recent commits first.

    >>> changed = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recently-changed')
    >>> print changed.fetch('a')[-1]['href']
    /+recently-changed-branches

    >>> browser.getLink(url='recently-changed-branches').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Recently changed branches
    >>> browser.goBack()


== Recently imported ==

Recently imported branches are ordered by recent commits only in
imported branches.

    >>> imported = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recent-imports')
    >>> print imported.fetch('a')[-1]['href']
    /+recently-imported-branches

    >>> browser.getLink(url='recently-imported-branches').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Recently imported branches
