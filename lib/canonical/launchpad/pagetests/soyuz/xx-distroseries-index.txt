DistroSeries page is reached by traversing the Distribution page with
a given name.

As it's main functionality this page allow users to search for binary
packages within the distroseries in context:

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty")
    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name="text").value = "a"
    >>> anon_browser.getControl("Find a Package").click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/+search?text=a'
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'search-results'))
    1 &rarr; 3 of 3 results
    First &bull; Previous &bull; Next &bull; Last

== Latest uploads page ==

This page provides raw list of the last five source packages uploaded
and published for a given distroseries.

Each entry contains:

 * source name & source version, linking to the LP page for this package
 * ubuntu maintainer, linking to a valid LP user
 * age, as approximateduration representation of the time passed since
   the upload was done.

  >>> anon_browser.open(
  ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/+portlet-latestuploads")
  >>> latest_uploads = str(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents,
  ...                      "latest-uploads"))
  >>> 'mozilla-firefox 0.9' in latest_uploads
  True
  >>> 'Mark Shuttleworth' in latest_uploads
  True

The link presented points to the SourcePackageRelease inside the
DistroSeries in question (a IDRSPR), we can check for consistency
clicking on it:

  >>> anon_browser.getLink("mozilla-firefox 0.9").click()
  >>> anon_browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/+source/mozilla-firefox/0.9'

Empty results are also presented properly (even if they are quite rare
in production environment):

  >>> anon_browser.open(
  ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntutest/breezy-autotest/"
  ...     "+portlet-latestuploads")
  >>> "<ul" in anon_browser.contents
  False
