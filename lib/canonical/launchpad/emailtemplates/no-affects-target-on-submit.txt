You didn't specify on what you want to file a bug on. A new bug has to
affect either a product or a distribution. Please use the 'affects'
command in order to specify on what you want to file a bug on. For
example, in order to file a bug on Launchpad itself, use:

    affects /products/malone

To file a bug on Firefox in Ubuntu:

    affects /distros/ubuntu/firefox

To file a bug on Ubuntu without specifying a package:

    affects /distros/ubuntu
