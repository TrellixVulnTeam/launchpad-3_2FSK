    <p>
      You can stake a claim to any unclaimed bounty, but must then begin to
      deliver code on a regular schedule, or forfeit the claim to someone
      else.  The reviewer will decide when the submission is complete, and can
      also rule that a claimant is making no progress, which will make the
      bounty available again. Payments will be made by Paypal, wire transfer
      can also be made for bounties in excess of $500.
