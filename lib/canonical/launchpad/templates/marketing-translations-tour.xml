    <title>Translation for everyone</title>
    <summary>Translators shouldn't have to be coders. Launchpad's simple web
      interface makes it easy for anyone to translate software into their own
      language.

    <callout top="" left="">New contributors want to know where their work is
      needed. Launchpad gives an overview of the translation status of each
      application: purple, green and blue represent translated strings, red is
      untranslated.

      both within your own community and with other communities.

    <callout top="" left="">Maintaining the quality of your translations is
      vital. Balancing quality with low barriers to entry can be difficult.
      Launchpad offers you three translation policies, from fully open to
      restricted.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">If you choose a fully open policy, anyone can make
      a translation and anyone can review a translation. Alternatively, you
      can appoint individuals or teams as trusted translators for each
      language.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">Common phrases reoccur in the interfaces of many
      applications. When you're translating a string, Launchpad finds other
      places where it has already been translated and tells you how it appears
      there. You're free to accept Launchpad's suggestion or to enter your own
      translation.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">When you begin work on a new release of your
      software, translators should be free to continue work on previous
      releases. With Launchpad, you can maintain separate translation efforts
      for each release.
