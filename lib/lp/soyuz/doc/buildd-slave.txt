Buildd Slave
============

Buildd Slave is an application independent of Launchpad Database, so
it has its own configuration file and depends only of sbuild package

It consists basically of an wrapper of sbuild process through an XMLRPC
Server interface. It requires read access to the current Librarian machine
to download needed files for the build job.

See more initialization details in canonical/buildd/tests/harness.py

  >>> from canonical.buildd.tests import BuilddSlaveTestSetup
  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

== BuilderSet polling operations ==

    >>> import logging
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.builder import IBuilderSet
    >>> logger = logging.getLogger()
    >>> builder_set = getUtility(IBuilderSet)

Retrieve a known DistroArchSeries.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> hoary_i386 = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['hoary']['i386']
    >>> warty_i386 = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['warty']['i386']

Create a totally bogus CHROOT.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import LibraryFileAlias
    >>> fake_chroot = LibraryFileAlias.get(1)
    >>> unused = hoary_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(fake_chroot)
    >>> unused = warty_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(fake_chroot)

Initialise the BuildMaster with all its builders.
Because the sampledata builders are busy we issue and warning stating
that.

    >>> builder_set.checkBuilders(logging, transaction)

Scan active builders looking for information about current jobs,
collect result of finished jobs, everything is stored directly in
the Launchpad DB. (simply check if it doesn't explode)

    >>> builder_set.scanActiveBuilders(logging, transaction)
    WARNING:...:Builder http://localhost:8221/ forgot about
    buildqueue 1 -- resetting buildqueue record

Tested, time to shutdown.

  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()

At this point the buildd-slave is not accessible anymore.

  >>> import xmlrpclib
  >>> s = xmlrpclib.Server('http://localhost:8221/rpc/')
  >>> s.info()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
