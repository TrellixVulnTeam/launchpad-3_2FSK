    >>> import email, re
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub

Setup the stub KeyServer:

    >>> z.setUp()


== Claim an encrypting GPG key ==

This test verifies the basic claim a GPG key workflow.

Start out with a clean page containing no imported keys:

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+edit")
    >>> browser.getLink('OpenPGP Keys').click()
    >>> browser.title
    "Sample Person's OpenPGP keys"
    >>> browser.getControl(name='DEACTIVATE_GPGKEY')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: name 'DEACTIVATE_GPGKEY'

Claim OpenPGP key:

    >>> key = "A419AE861E88BC9E04B9C26FBA2B9389DFD20543"
    >>> browser.getControl(name='fingerprint').value = key
    >>> browser.getControl(name='import').click()
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    A message has been sent to test@canonical.com, encrypted
    with the key 1024D/DFD20543.
    To confirm the key is yours, decrypt the message and follow the
    link inside.

Recover token URL from the encrypted part, but also make sure there's a clear
text part that provides useful information to users who -- for whatever reason
-- cannot decrypt the token url.  Start by grabbing the confirmation message.

    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> msg = email.message_from_string(raw_msg)
    >>> msg.get_content_type()
    'text/plain'

The message will be a single text/plain part with clear text instructions,
followed by ASCII armored encrypted confirmation instructions.  Ensure that
the clear text instructions contain the expected URLs pointing to more help.

    >>> cipher_body = msg.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print cipher_body
    Hello,
    <BLANKLINE>
    This message contains the instructions for confirming registration of an
    OpenPGP key for use in Launchpad.  The confirmation instructions have been
    encrypted with the OpenPGP key you have attempted to register.  If you cannot
    read the unencrypted instructions below, it may be because your mail reader
    does not support automatic decryption of "ASCII armored" encrypted text.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Exact instructions for enabling this depends on the specific mail reader you
    are using.  Please see this support page for more information:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interaction import setupInteraction
    >>> setupInteraction(None)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IGPGHandler
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> gpghandler = getUtility(IGPGHandler)

Import the secret keys needed for this test:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import (
    ...     import_secret_test_key, decrypt_content, sign_content)
    >>> import_secret_test_key('test@canonical.com.sec')

'cipher_body' is a message encrypted with the just-imported
1024D/DFD20543 OpenPGP key, we need to access the current IGpghandler
instance to access this key and decrypt the message.

    >>> body = decrypt_content(cipher_body, 'test')

    >>> from zope.security.management import endInteraction
    >>> endInteraction()

Extract the token URL from the email:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.logintoken import (
    ...     get_token_url_from_string)
    >>> token_url = get_token_url_from_string(body)

Go to the link sent by email, to validate the email address.

    >>> browser.open(token_url)

Get redirected to +validategpg, and confirm token:

    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/token/.../+validategpg
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

Get redirected to the user's homepage with a greeting:

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~name12'
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    The key 1024D/DFD20543 was successfully validated.
    ...

Certify the key is imported:

    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editpgpkeys")
    >>> browser.getControl(name='DEACTIVATE_GPGKEY').displayOptions
    ['1024D/DFD20543']

Make sure that UIDs were properly processed; in particular, check that
"sample.revoked@canonical.com", the revoked UID in the key, wasn't
added as an email address:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import strip_label

    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editemails")
    >>> control = browser.getControl(name='field.UNVALIDATED_SELECTED')
    >>> [strip_label(label) for label in sorted(control.displayOptions)]
    ['sample.person@canonical.com', 'testtest@canonical.com']

Verify that the key was imported with the "can encrypt" flag set:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import GPGKey
    >>> key = GPGKey.selectOneBy(
    ...     fingerprint='A419AE861E88BC9E04B9C26FBA2B9389DFD20543')
    >>> print key.owner.name
    name12
    >>> print key.can_encrypt
    True


== Claim a sign-only GPG key ==

Here, Sample Person wants to claim a GPG key that can only sign
content. He can't verify his key by decrypting content on demand, but
he can verify it by signing content. Launchpad sends him an email
token. The email step ensures that an attacker who knows Sample
Person's Launchpad password can't associate arbitrary GPG keys with
their Launchpad account.

    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editpgpkeys")

    >>> fingerprint = "447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F"
    >>> browser.getControl(name='fingerprint').value = fingerprint
    >>> browser.getControl(name='import').click()
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    A message has been sent to test@canonical.com. To
    confirm the key 1024D/17B05A8F is yours, follow
    the link inside.

Sample Person checks his email.

    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> msg = email.message_from_string(raw_msg)
    >>> msg.get_content_type()
    'text/plain'
    >>> body = msg.get_payload(decode=True)

The email is not encrypted, since Sample Person didn't claim the
ability to decrypt text with this key.

    >>> '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----' in body
    False

The email does contain some information about the key, and a token URL
Sample Person should visit to verify his ownership of the key.

    >>> print body
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hello,
    ...
        User name    : Sample Person
        Email address: test@canonical.com
    ...
        Fingerprint : 447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F
      Key type/ID : 1024D/17B05A8F
    <BLANKLINE>
    UIDs:
        sign.only@canonical.com
    ...
        http://launchpad.dev/token/...

    >>> token_url = get_token_url_from_string(body)

Side note: in a little while, Sample User will be asked to sign some
text which includes the date the token was generated (to avoid replay
attacks). To make this testable, we set the creation date of this
token to a fixed value:

    >>> nothing, token_value = token_url.split('http://launchpad.dev/token/')

    >>> import pytz, datetime
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import LoginToken
    >>> logintoken = LoginToken.selectOneBy(token=token_value)
    >>> logintoken.created = datetime.datetime(2005,04,01, 12,00,00,
    ...                                        tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> logintoken.sync()

Back to Sample User. He visits the token URL and is asked to sign some
text to prove he owns the key.

    >>> browser.open(token_url)
    >>> browser.title
    'Confirm sign-only OpenPGP key'

Let's look at the text.

    >>> verification_content = find_main_content(
    ...     browser.contents).pre.string
    >>> print verification_content
    Please register 447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F to the
    Launchpad user name12.  2005-04-01 12:00:00 UTC

If he refuses to sign the text, he gets an error message.

    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.title
    'Confirm sign-only OpenPGP key'
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    There is 1 error.
    Required input is missing.

If he signs a different text, he gets an error message.

    >>> import_secret_test_key('sign.only@canonical.com.sec')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import sign_content
    >>> bad = sign_content(
    ...     'This is not the verification message!',
    ...     '447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F', 'test')
    >>> browser.getControl('Signed text').value = bad
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    There is 1 error.
    The signed content does not match the message found in the email.

If he signs the text with a different key, he gets an error
message. The following text was signed with the key DFD20543:

    >>> signed_content = """
    ... -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

    >>> browser.getControl('Signed text').value = signed_content
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    There is 1 error.
    The key used to sign the content (A419AE861E88BC9E04B9C26FBA2B9389DFD20543)
    is not the key you were registering

If he signs the text correctly, he is redirected to his home page.

    >>> good = sign_content(
    ...     str(verification_content),
    ...     '447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F', 'test')
    >>> browser.getControl('Signed text').value = good
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~name12'

The address associated with the key is not associated with his
Launchpad account, so Launchpad gives him a message to that effect.

    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    The key 1024D/17B05A8F was successfully validated.
    Some of your key's UIDs (sign.only@canonical.com) are not registered...

Now that the key has been validated, the login token is consumed:

    >>> LoginToken.selectOneBy(token=token_value).date_consumed is not None
    True

Now Sample Person's sign-only key is associated with his account. He
verifies this:

    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editpgpkeys")

    >>> content = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> browser.getControl(name='DEACTIVATE_GPGKEY').displayOptions
    [...'1024D/17B05A8F (sign only)']

On a mad whim he decides to de-activate the key he just imported.

    >>> browser.getControl(name="DEACTIVATE_GPGKEY").value = ['3']
    >>> browser.getControl('Deactivate Key').click()

    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    Deactivated key(s): 1024D/17B05A8F

Coming to his senses, he asks for a re-validation of the key.

    >>> browser.getControl(name="REACTIVATE_GPGKEY").value = ['3']
    >>> browser.getControl('Reactivate Key').click()

    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    A message has been sent to test@canonical.com with instructions
    to reactivate these key(s): 1024D/17B05A8F

He opens the page and checks that the key is displayed as pending
revalidation.

    >>> browser.reload()
    >>> browser.getControl(name='REMOVE_GPGTOKEN').displayOptions
    ['447DBF38C4F9C4ED752246B77D88913717B05A8F']

(We won't run through the whole validation process again, as this key isn't
used in any more tests.)
