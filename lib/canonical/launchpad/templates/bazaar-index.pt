    Launchpad is integrated with the <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>
    version control system.
    (<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/WhyUseBzr">Why use Bazaar?</a>)
  </p>

  <h2>Branch registry</h2>

  <p>
    To register a branch so other people can find it,
    go to the page of the product the branch belongs to,
    and click &ldquo;Register Bazaar Branch&rdquo;.
    Launchpad will automatically maintain a mirror of the branch.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can register a branch on behalf someone else from that person&rsquo;s
    page,
    or by setting the author field when registering a branch on a product.
    (The URL of the branch mirror is based on the nickname of
    the registrant, not the author.)
  </p>

  <h2>VCS imports</h2>

  <p>
    If the project you are working on uses CVS or Subversion, Launchpad can
    produce a Bazaar branch that is synchronised daily with the HEAD or trunk
    of the project, so you can use Bazaar to manage you own changes even if the
    project leaders do not.
  </p>

  <p>
    To set up a VCS import, edit the source details of the trunk release series
    of the product.
  </p>

  <h2>Hosted branches</h2>

  <p>
    Launchpad provides hosting for Bazaar branches.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, you need to register a SSH key from your person's page. Click on
    your name at the top of any Launchpad page when logged in to go to your
    person's page.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a hosted branch, use the <code>bzr push</code> command. When
    registering the first branch for a product, you may have to use the
    <code>--create-prefix</code> option. The destination URL must be of the
    form:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
    sftp://<i>user</i>@bazaar.launchpad.net/~<i>registrant</i>/<i>product</i>/<i>branch</i>
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li><i>user</i> is your short name in Launchpad. It can be ommitted if it
    is the same as your system login or if you specify it in your ssh
    configuration.</li>

    <li><i>registrant</i> is your short name in Launchpad. For example, the
    nickname of Mark Shuttleworth is <code>sabdfl</code>. It can be a team name
    for shared branches.</li>

    <li><i>product</i> is the short name of the Launchpad product the branch
    belongs to. For example, if you are contributing code to the Bzrk plugin
    for Bazaar itself, the product name is <code>bzrk</code>.</li>

    <li><i>name</i> is the short name of the branch, it needs only be
    unique for a given <code>person</code> and a given <code>product</code>.
    For example, if you are publishing your main development branch on
    Launchpad, you can use <code>dev</code> as a branch name, even if that name
    is used by other people for the same product.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To create a shared branch to which multiple people can commit and push, as
    with CVS or Subversion, use the name of a team you belong to as the
    <i>registrant</i>. All the members of that team will be able to edit the
    branch details and to push to that branch.
  </p>

  <h2>Integration with other services</h2>

  <p>
    You can associate a branch to a <a href="/malone">Malone<a> bug report, for
    example if the branch contains a fix for the bug, instead of attaching a
    patch the old-fashioned way.
