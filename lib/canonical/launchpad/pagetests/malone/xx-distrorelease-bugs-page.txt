== The Distribution Release Bugs Page ==

The front page for a distribution release on the bugs domain presents
some basic information the bugs in it. It doesn't display the list of
bugs.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty')
    >>> anon_browser.title
    'Bugs in The Warty Warthog Release'

    >>> find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'buglisting') is None
    True

The page has a link to see all open bugs.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Show all open bugs').click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/+bugs'
    >>> find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'buglisting') is not None
    True

== Bugs Fixed Elsewhere ==

The Bugs frontpage includes the number of bugs that are fixed in some
other context.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty')
    >>> fixed_elsewhere_link = anon_browser.getLink('bugs fixed elsewhere')
    >>> fixed_elsewhere_link.text
    '0 bugs fixed elsewhere'

The link takes you to the list of the bugs fixed elsewhere.

    >>> fixed_elsewhere_link.click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://.../+bugs?field.status_upstream=only_resolved_upstream'

    >>> print find_main_content(anon_browser.contents)
    <...
    <p>There are currently no open bugs.</p>
    ...

== Bugs Statistics ==

There's also some statistics about the open and fixed bugs. This is
displayed as a chart, which is generated using Javascript, but for those
browsers not supporting Javascript, the statistics are displayed as
normal text:

As opposed to the normal distribution Bugs page, Fix Released bugs are
included here, since it's a good measurement of seeing wether the
release is on track.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty')
    >>> stats_div = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'bugs-chart')
    >>> for li_tag in stats_div.noscript.ul('li'):
    ...     print li_tag.renderContents()
    1 Unconfirmed bugs
    0 Needs Info bugs
    0 Confirmed bugs
    0 In Progress bugs
    0 Fix Committed bugs
