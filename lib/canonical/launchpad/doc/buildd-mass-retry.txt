'buildd-mass-retry' is a tool designed to retry a group of 'failed'
build records in a distrorelease and/or architecture.

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools",
  ...                       "buildd-mass-retry.py")

The user can specify a distribution, a suite name (-s) and/or and
architecture (-a) as a build record provider, it will restrict the
target group.

Also, can combine the types of failure we allow to be retried:

 * -F: retry builds marked as FAILEDTOBUILD
 * -D: retry builds marked as MANUALDEPWAIT
 * -C: retry builds marked as CHROOTWAIT

The available types can be combined acording the situation.

The script provides dry-run mode (-N).

See build.txt for more information about IBuild.retry().

Passing only suite, request retry on all failed states:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NFDC",
  ...                             "-s", "hoary"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stderr
  DEBUG   Intitialising connetion.

Passing an architecture, which contains no failed build records,
nothing is done:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NFDC",
  ...                             "-s", "hoary", "-a", "hppa"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stderr

Selecting only a specific failed state:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NF",
  ...                             "-s", "hoary"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
