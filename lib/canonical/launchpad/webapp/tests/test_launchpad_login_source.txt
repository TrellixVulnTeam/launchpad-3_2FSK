= LaunchpadLoginSource =

LaunchpadLoginSource is used to create principals, from login
information, passing the e-mail address to getPrincipalByLogin. If no
person is found with the given e-mail address, None is returned

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authentication import (
    ...     LaunchpadLoginSource)
    >>> login_source = LaunchpadLoginSource()
    >>> print login_source.getPrincipalByLogin('no-such-email@example.com')
    None

Giving getPrincipalByLogin() an existing e-mail address, returns a
ILaunchpadPrincipal with the same id as the corresponding Person record.

    >>> person = factory.makePerson(email='existing@example.com')
    >>> principal = login_source.getPrincipalByLogin('existing@example.com')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import ILaunchpadPrincipal
    >>> ILaunchpadPrincipal.providedBy(principal)
    True
    >>> principal.id == person.id
    True

The corresponding Person record is also in the principal, to make it
easier for the security machinery to get at it. It needs to get it quite
often, so having the Person record directly on the Principal improves
performance quite a lot, even compared to getting it from storm's cache.

    >>> principal.person == person
    True

The principal's person is security proxied.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import getChecker
    >>> getChecker(principal.person) is not None
    True
