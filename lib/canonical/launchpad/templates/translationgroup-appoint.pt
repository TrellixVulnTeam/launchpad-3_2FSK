        Here you can appoint a translator to be responsible for a particular
        language within this translation group.  One translator can take care
        of any number of languages, but the group can have only one translator
        for any single language.  To avoid mistakes, this form will not allow
        you to appoint a new translator for a language that already has a
        translator in this group.
      </p>
      <p>
        A translator does not have to be a single person.  If you want to have
        several people taking care of a single language in this translation
        group, make them a team and appoint that whole team as a translator.
