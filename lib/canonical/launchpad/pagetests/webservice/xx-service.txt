Some standard behavior is defined by the web service itself, not by
the individual resources.


== Nonexistent resources ==

An attempt to access a nonexistent resource yields a 404 error.

  >>> print webservice.get("/no-such-resource")
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...


== Nonexistent methods ==

An attempt to use an unsupported or nonexistent HTTP method on a
resource yields a 405 error.

  >>> print webservice("/", method="COPY")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET HEAD POST PATCH PUT DELETE OPTIONS
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/bugs")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/people")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET POST
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/~salgado")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET PUT PATCH
  ...

  >>> print webservice.delete("/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/+bug/1")
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET POST PUT PATCH
  ...


== Inappropriate media types ==

An attempt to PATCH a document with unsupported media type to a
resource yields a 415 error.

  >>> print webservice.patch("/~salgado", 'text/plain', "Foo")
  HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
  ...


== Resources not exposed on the web service ==

Soyuz build set (exposed on the web at +builds) are not available on the
web service:

    >>> print webservice.get("/+builds")
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...
