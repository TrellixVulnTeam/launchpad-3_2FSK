Person Locations
================

People can have a location and time zone in Launchpad.  In some cases, a
person has a time zone, but no location. We test that their home page renders
without problems.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> zzz = factory.makePerson(name='zzz', time_zone='Africa/Maseru',
    ...                          latitude=None, longitude=None)
    >>> logout()

Any person can see another person's time zone if their is also
location data set, otherwise the location portlet does not show up.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~zzz')
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'portlet-map'))
