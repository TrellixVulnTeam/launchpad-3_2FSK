= Launchpad administrator approval =

When a team requests a mailing list, this request must be approved by a
Launchpad administrator before the mailing list will be created.

Anonymous users cannot view the mailing list approval page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+mailinglists')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Ordinary users also cannot view this page.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+mailinglists')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

But Launchpad administrators can see the mailing list approval page.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+mailinglists')
    >>> admin_browser.title
    'Pending mailing lists requests'


== When there's nothing to do ==

When there are no pending mailing list requests, the page does not contain a
form with a submit button.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Submit')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Submit'

But there's a message explaining that there's nothing to do.

    >>> find_main_content(admin_browser.contents).p.renderContents()
    'There is nothing to do.'
