We allow any user to create random profiles that can latter be used
throughout Launchpad. These profiles are not considered validated and because
of that we won't send any email notification to them, except for an initial
email explaining that a given user has created a Launchpad profile for that
email address' owner.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people/+newperson')
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/people/+newperson'

All fields (email address, displayname and creation comment) in that form
are required.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Create Profile').click()
    >>> print user_browser.contents
    <...
    ...class="error message">There are 3 errors...

Trying to create a profile with an invalid or already used email address
is not allowed.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Email address').value = 'foo@'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Display name').value = 'Foo'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Creation comment').value = (
    ...     'I was just playing around and found this nice form, so I '
    ...     'decided to create a new profile to test.')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Create Profile').click()
    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    There is 1 error.
    foo@ isn't a valid email address.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Email address').value = 'test@canonical.com'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Create Profile').click()
    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    There is 1 error.
    test@canonical.com is already taken by <a...Sample Person...

When all fields are filled correctly, the new profile is created.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Email address').value = 'test2@canonical.com'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Create Profile').click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/people/test2'

    >>> print user_browser.contents
    <...
    ...This page was created on
    ...
    ...by ...
    ...and the reason given by that user for its creation is:...
    ...I was just playing around and found this nice form,...

The creation of this new profile will trigger an email notification to the
profile's email address. This email will contain the name of the person who
created the profile as well as the comment left by that person. It'll also
contain a link to a page where it's possible to finish the registration
process in order to validate that profile.

    >>> import email
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.logintoken import (
    ...     get_token_url_from_email)
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> token_url = get_token_url_from_email(raw_msg)

    >>> print email.message_from_string(raw_msg).get_payload()
