So now Foo Bar is the Afrikaans translator for the PolyGlot translation
group, and they are the translation group for Ubuntu, which has Closed
translations. This means that Foo Bar should be able to translate any
strings in Ubuntu to Afrikaans. In other languages, Foo Bar should be
warned that he is not a designated translator.

Let's see if Foo Bar can see the translated strings in Southern Sotho. We
expect them to be told they can only make contributions:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/st/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...You are not an official translator for this file...
  ...

However, in Afrikaans, Foo Bar DOES have the ability to edit directly.

First, we show that "evolution minicard" is not translated.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,af;q=0.3
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...<input type="text" lang="af"
      dir="ltr" name="set_137_translation_af_0" tabindex="15" />
  ...

Now, we need to show that it is translated after a post. Let's go ahead and
POST and see that all goes well:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,af;q=0.3
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 486
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... count=10&offset=0&show=all&set_130_msgid=&set_130_translation_af_0=&set_131_msgid=&set_131_translation_af_0=&set_132_msgid=&set_132_translation_af_0=&set_133_msgid=&set_133_translation_af_0=&set_134_msgid=&set_134_translation_af_0=&set_135_msgid=&set_135_translation_af_0=+kaart&set_136_msgid=&set_136_translation_af_0=&set_137_msgid=&set_137_translation_af_0=evolution+minikaart&set_138_msgid=&set_138_translation_af_0=&set_139_msgid=&set_139_translation_af_0=&SUBMIT=Save+%26+Continue""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

And finally, let's take a look again, and we should have a translation or
two added:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,af;q=0.3
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...<input type="text" lang="af"
      dir="ltr" name="set_137_translation_af_0"
      value="evolution minikaart" tabindex="15" />
  ...
