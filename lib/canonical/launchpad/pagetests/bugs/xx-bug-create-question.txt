= Create a question from a bug =

Some bugs that are filed, aren't really bugs, they are questions.
When the bug target's pillar uses Launchpad to track bugs, the
bug can be converted to a question. The process creates a new
question using the bug's owner, title, and description. The bug's
status is set to Invalid in every location that it affects.

Thunderbird does not use Launchpad to track bugs. Questions cannot
be made from its bugs.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/thunderbird/+bug/9')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #9 in Mozilla Thunderbird: ...Thunderbird crashes...'
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Is a question')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

An user with permission to edit a bug may create a question from
a bug. An anonymous user cannot create a question.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10')
    >>> anon_browser.title
    'Bug #10 in linux-source-2.6.15 (Ubuntu): ...another test bug...'
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Is a question').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):

No Privileges Person is doing triage for Ubuntu. He recognizes bug 10
is really a question. He chooses to make a question from it.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 in linux-source-2.6.15 (Ubuntu): ...another test bug...'
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Is a question').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 - Create a question from this bug'

The 'Create a question from this bug' page explains what will happen
if No Privileges Person chooses the 'Create a Question' button at the
bottom of the page. A single radio button indicates that the only
option a user can take with this page is to create a question. No
other input is needed. No Privileges Person must choose between the
'Cancel' button and the 'Create a Question' button. He decides to
create the question.

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>... this bug's status will be Invalid for all locations it affects...
     The new question will be linked to this bug...

    >>> control = user_browser.getControl(name='field.create_question')
    >>> # Strip the non-breaking space embedded in the label.
    >>> [option[1:] for option in control.displayOptions]
    ['This bug is a question.']

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Cancel').type
    'submit'

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Create a Question').click()

No Privileges Person is shown the bug page again. There is a notice
confirming that the question was created. The question has the same
title and the bug. The bug status is Invalid for 'linux-source-2.6.15
(Ubuntu)', and the comment about the last change states that the bug is
a question.

    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 in linux-source-2.6.15 (Ubuntu): ...another test bug...'

    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'mainarea')
    >>> content(['p'], {'class' : 'informational message'})
    [...A question was created from this bug:

    Comment on most recent change
    This is not a bug. It is a question...

No Privileges Person can see the link to the question in the 'Related
questions' portlet. After noting that Foo Bar is the bug owner, he
uses the link to see the question page.

    >>> print extract_text(content(['img'], src='/@@/bug-medium')[0].parent)
    Bug #10, first reported on 2004-01-10 by Foo Bar

    >>> question_anchor = content(['div'], {'id' : 'portlet-questions'})[0].a
    >>> question_anchor
    <a href=".../ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+question/...">another
    test bug</a>

    >>> user_browser.getLink('another test bug').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'linux-source-2.6.15 in ubuntu question #...: ...another test bug...'

No Privileges Person sees that the question status is Open and
that is was asked by Foo Bar. Foo Bar is the only subscriber to
this question (a question in Ubuntu would have many indirect
subscribers in the real world). As No Privileges Person is not
the question owner, he is invited to help answer the problem.
He uses the link to Related bug to return to the bug.

    >>> content = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(content(['img'], src='/@@/question')[0].parent)
    Open Question #..., asked ... by Foo Bar

    >>> question_id = user_browser.url.split('/')[-1]
    >>> portlet_heading = 'Subscribers to question #%s' % question_id
    >>> portlet = find_portlet(user_browser.contents, portlet_heading)
    >>> portlet.a
    <a href="/~name16">Foo Bar</a>

    >>> content.h2
    <h2>...Can you help with this problem?...</h2>

    >>> user_browser.getControl("Add Answer").type
    'submit'

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(user_browser.contents, 'Related bugs')
    >>> portlet.a
    <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/10">#10: another test bug</a>

    >>> user_browser.getLink('#10: another test bug').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 in linux-source-2.6.15 (Ubuntu): ...another test bug...'

Foo Bar received an email informing him that he asked a question. He
used the link the email to view the page in his browser.

    >>> admin_browser.open(question_anchor['href'])
    >>> admin_browser.title
    'linux-source-2.6.15 in ubuntu question #...: ...another test bug...'

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Problem Solved').type
    'submit'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("I'm Providing More Information").type
    'submit'
