        """Copy in all of the parent distroseries's configuration. This
        includes all configuration for distroseries and distroarchseries
        publishing and all publishing records for sources and binaries.

        Preconditions:
          The distroseries must have been set up with its distroarchseriess
          as needed. It should have its nominated arch-indep set up along
          with all other basic requirements for the structure of the
          distroseries. This distroseries and all its distroarchseriess
          must have empty publishing sets. Section and component selections
          must be empty.

        Outcome:
          The publishing structure will be copied from the parent. All
          PUBLISHED and PENDING packages in the parent will be created in
          this distroseries and its distroarchseriess. The lucille config
          will be copied in, all component and section selections will be
          duplicated as will any permission-related structures.

        Note:
          This method will assert all of its preconditions where possible.
          After this is run, you still need to construct chroots for building,
          you need to add anything missing wrt. ports etc. This method is
          only meant to give you a basic copy of a parent series in order
          to assist you in preparing a new series of a distribution or
          in the initialisation of a derivative.
