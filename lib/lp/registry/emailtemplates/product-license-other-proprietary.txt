Proprietary projects can use Launchpad by purchasing a commercial-use
subscription which costs US$250/year/project.  Follow the instructions
presented on your project overview page to purchase a subscription
voucher.

Launchpad is a collaboration site that is free to use for projects
with an approved open source license.  When you registered your
project the list of licenses presented are the ones we automatically
recognize.

Other licenses must follow the guidelines we list on the following
page in order to be approved:
https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?" which can be found at:
https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208

If the license for your project needs to be corrected you can do so by
following the 'Change Details' link on your project's overview page.

Thanks,

The Launchpad team.
