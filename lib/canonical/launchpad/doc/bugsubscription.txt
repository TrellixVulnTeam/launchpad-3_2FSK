Introduction
============

Bugs are problems reported in software. Bugs can be assigned to packages and
products to be fixed. People can "subscribe" to bugs. This document is about
people subscribing to bugs.

Subscription Types
==================

There are three kinds of bug subscription.

Cc: A Person chooses to receive notification emails related to this bug.

Watch: A Person chooses to see this bug in their web reports.

Ignore: A Person (e.g. a package maintainer), chooses to not receive emails
about this bug, when normally they would have.

Accessing Bug Subscriber Lists
==============================

Sometimes you'll want to know which people are subscribed to a bug. For
example, you might want to send out a notification email to everyone that is
Cc'd on a bug when something changes.

To get the set of subscriptions to a bug, Launchpad provides an adapter from an
IBug to an IBugSubscriptionSet.

    >>> from zope.component import getAdapter
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Bug
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSubscriptionSet
    >>> bug = Bug.get(1)
    >>> subscriptions = getAdapter(bug, IBugSubscriptionSet, '')
    >>> subscriptions.getCcEmailAddresses()
    [u'mark@hbd.com', u'scott.james.remnant@ubuntulinux.com', u'steve.alexander@ubuntulinux.com', u'test@canonical.com']
