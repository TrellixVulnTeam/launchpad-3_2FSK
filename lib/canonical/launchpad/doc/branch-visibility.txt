= Branch Visibility =

Most branches on launchpad are considered public branches, and are
visible to everybody, even people not logged in.

Some branches are also considered "private".  These are branches that
are only visible to a specific team of people.  This team is specified
on the branch in the attribute visibility_team.  If the visibility_team
is not set then the branch is "public".

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
    >>> branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUniqueName('~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned')

    >>> print branch.name
