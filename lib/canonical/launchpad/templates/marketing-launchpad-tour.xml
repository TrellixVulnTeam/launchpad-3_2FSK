        projects
    </headline>
    <summary>
      <p>Collaboration is crucial to free software projects.
          Traditionally, it has been difficult for communities to exchange
          information if they use different tools.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout this tour, you'll see how Launchpad's new approach
          solves the problems of collaboration on software projects. By
          bringing together information from different project-specific
          sources and helping communities to organise themselves into teams,
          Launchpad helps different projects to collaborate on common
          problems, such as bugs in shared code.
      </p>
      <p>Let's start by finding our way around the interface.</p>

      <p>Strong communities are built on teams. Launchpad helps communities to
        develop rich structures, through the effortless creation of teams

        roles in projects, such as acting as a bug contact for a project.
