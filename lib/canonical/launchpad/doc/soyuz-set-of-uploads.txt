= Soyuz Set of Uploads Test =

This test will:

  * Pre-create the directory structure
  * Turn on the zeca keyserver
  * Run process-upload.py
  * Check result
  * Mark packages as ACCEPTED
  * Runs process-accepted.py
  * Check results
  * Cleanup


== Pre-creating directories ==

First, let's create the temporary directory structure where we'll put uploaded
files in.

  >>> import os
  >>> import tempfile
  >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
  >>> incoming_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "incoming")
  >>> accepted_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "accepted")
  >>> rejected_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "rejected")
  >>> failed_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "failed")
  >>> os.mkdir(incoming_dir)


== A note about error checking ==

To be able to process the entire upload and provide the full set of
errors, we need:
  1. A changes file with no syntax errors
  2. A changes file with at least a valid email address for the
     changed-by field or the package signer, both of which must be registered
     in Launchpad.
  3. A changes file with a valid distroseries and pocket (e.g. gutsy-updates)
  4. A changes file that enumerates all the files in the upload, with
     correct md5 sum and file sizes.
  5. Actual files uploaded that match the ones described in the changes file.
 
 If (1) is not available, the upload silently fails.
 If (2) is not available, the upload silently fails.
 If (3) or (4) is not available, the upload is rejected immediately with
 no further checking.
 If any files in (5) are missing, we report as much information as we can
 about what is available.


== Processing Uploads ==

Before asking the system to process the upload, we must prepare the
database and services to receive it. Since we're using
'sample.person@canonical.com' as our Changed-By address and his
key has signed all the relevant uploads in the suite of uploads we're
using, this essentially boils down to ensuring that zeca and the
librarian are running and making sure that the key is attached to the
relevant launchpad person.

  >>> from canonical.zeca.ftests.harness import ZecaTestSetup
  >>> ZecaTestSetup().setUp()

Import public keyring into current LPDB.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

Having set up that infrastructure we need to prepare a breezy distroseries
for the ubuntutest distribution.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Distribution
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import DistroSeriesSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import LibraryFileAlias
  >>> ubuntu = Distribution.byName('ubuntu')
  >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntu['breezy-autotest']
  >>> ubuntutest = Distribution.byName('ubuntutest')
  >>> drs = DistroSeriesSet()
  >>> breezy = drs.new(
  ...     ubuntutest, 'breezy', 'Breezy Badger', 'The Breezy Badger',
  ...     'Black and White', 'Someone', '5.10', breezy_autotest,
  ...     breezy_autotest.owner)
  >>> breezy_i386 = breezy.newArch(
  ...     'i386', breezy_autotest['i386'].processorfamily, True, breezy.owner)
  >>> breezy.nominatedarchindep = breezy_i386
  >>> breezy.changeslist = 'breezy-changes@ubuntu.com'
  >>> breezy.initialiseFromParent()
  >>> fake_chroot = LibraryFileAlias.get(1)
  >>> unused = breezy_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(fake_chroot)

Add disk content for file inherited from ubuntu/breezy-autotest:

  >>> from canonical.librarian.ftests.harness import fillLibrarianFile
  >>> fillLibrarianFile(54)

Now that the infrastructure is ready, we prepare a set of useful methods.

Firstly, we need a way to copy a test upload into the queue (but skip
lock files, which have names starting with a dot).

  >>> from canonical.archiveuploader.tests import datadir
  >>> def punt_upload_into_queue(leaf, distro):
  ...     inc_dir = os.path.join(incoming_dir, leaf, distro)
  ...     os.makedirs(inc_dir)
  ...     for file_leaf in os.listdir(datadir(os.path.join("suite", leaf))):
  ...         os.system("cp %s %s" % (
  ...             datadir(os.path.join("suite", leaf, file_leaf)), inc_dir))

We need a way to count the items in a queue directory

  >>> def count_items(queue):
  ...     return len(queue)

And then we need a way to process the uploads from the queue

  >>> import logging
  >>> from canonical.config import config
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.logger import MockLogger
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.soyuz_process_upload import (
  ...     ProcessUpload)
  >>> from canonical.lp import initZopeless
  >>> from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
  >>> def process_uploads(upload_policy, build_id, series, loglevel):
  ...     """Simulate process-upload.py script run.
  ...
  ...     :param upload_policy: context in which to consider the upload
  ...         (equivalent to script's --context option).
  ...     :param build_id: build to which to attach this upload.
  ...         (equivalent to script's --buildid option).
  ...     :param series: distro series to give back from.
  ...         (equivalent to script's --series option).
  ...     :param loglevel: logging level (as defined in logging module).  Any
  ...         log messages below this level will be suppressed.
  ...     """
  ...     args = [temp_dir, "-C", upload_policy]
  ...     if build_id is not None:
  ...         args.extend(["-b", build_id])
  ...     if series is not None:
  ...         args.extend(["-s", series])
  ...     # Run script under 'uploader' DB user.  The dbuser argument to the
  ...     # script constructor is ignored, so we must change DB users here.
  ...     LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn.commit()
  ...     LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(config.uploader.dbuser)
  ...     process = ProcessUpload(
  ...         'process-upload', dbuser='ignored', test_args=args)
  ...     process.logger = MockLogger()
  ...     if loglevel is not None:
  ...         process.logger.setLevel(loglevel)
  ...     process.txn = LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn
  ...     process.main()
  ...     LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser('launchpad')

And we need a way to process the accepted queue

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackageUploadStatus
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate

  >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

  >>> def process_accepted(distro):
  ...     distribution = getUtility(IDistributionSet)[distro]
  ...     for series in distribution.serieses:
  ...         items = series.getQueueItems(
  ...            status=PackageUploadStatus.ACCEPTED)
  ...         for item in items:
  ...             item.realiseUpload()
  ...             syncUpdate(item)


If an upload of ours ends up in the NEW queue, we need a way to process
it into the accepted queue

  >>> def process_new(distro, series):
  ...     distribution = getUtility(IDistributionSet)[distro]
  ...     if series is None:
  ...         series = "breezy"
  ...     dr, pocket = distribution.getDistroSeriesAndPocket(series)
  ...     items = dr.getQueueItems(status=PackageUploadStatus.NEW)
  ...     for item in items:
  ...         item.setAccepted()
  ...         syncUpdate(item)
  ...     items = dr.getQueueItems(status=PackageUploadStatus.UNAPPROVED)
  ...     for item in items:
  ...         item.setAccepted()
  ...         syncUpdate(item)

Finally, as a very simplistic publishing process, we may need to punt any
given upload into the published state, so here's a very simplistic publisher

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory as SPPH,
  ...     BinaryPackagePublishingHistory as BPPH)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingStatus as PPS
  >>> from canonical.database.constants import UTC_NOW
  >>> def simple_publish(distro):
  ...     srcs_to_publish = SPPH.select("""
  ...         SourcePackagePublishingHistory.distroseries = DistroSeries.id
  ...     AND DistroSeries.distribution = Distribution.id
  ...     AND Distribution.name = '%s'
  ...     AND SourcePackagePublishingHistory.status = 1""" % distro,
  ...         clauseTables=['DistroSeries', 'Distribution'])
  ...     bins_to_publish = BPPH.select("""
  ...         BinaryPackagePublishingHistory.distroarchseries =
  ...             DistroArchSeries.id
  ...     AND DistroArchSeries.distroseries = DistroSeries.id
  ...     AND DistroSeries.distribution = Distribution.id
  ...     AND Distribution.name = '%s'
  ...     AND BinaryPackagePublishingHistory.status = 1""" % distro,
  ...         clauseTables=['DistroArchSeries', 'DistroSeries',
  ...                       'Distribution'])
  ...     published_one = False
  ...     for src in srcs_to_publish:
  ...         sec_src = src.secure_record
  ...         sec_src.status = PPS.PUBLISHED
  ...         sec_src.datepublished = UTC_NOW
  ...         syncUpdate(sec_src)
  ...         published_one = True
  ...     for bin in bins_to_publish:
  ...         sec_bin = bin.secure_record
  ...         sec_bin.status = PPS.PUBLISHED
  ...         sec_bin.datepublished = UTC_NOW
  ...         syncUpdate(sec_bin)
  ...         published_one = True
  ...     return published_one


We'll be doing a lot of uploads with sanity checks, and expect them to succeed.
A helper function, simulate_upload does that with all the checking.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> import shutil
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub

  >>> def simulate_upload(
  ...     leafname, is_new=False, upload_policy='anything', build_id=None,
  ...     series=None, distro="ubuntutest", loglevel=logging.WARN):
  ...     """Process upload(s).  Options are as for process_uploads()."""
  ...     punt_upload_into_queue(leafname, distro=distro)
  ...     process_uploads(upload_policy, build_id, series, loglevel)
  ...     # We seem to be leaving a lock file behind here for some reason.
  ...     # Naturally it doesn't count as an unprocessed incoming file, which
  ...     # is what we're really looking for.
  ...     lockfile = os.path.join(incoming_dir, '.lock')
  ...     if os.access(lockfile, os.F_OK):
  ...         os.remove(lockfile)
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(incoming_dir)) == 0, (
  ...         "Incoming should be empty: %s" % os.listdir(incoming_dir))
  ...
  ...     rejected_contents = os.listdir(rejected_dir)
  ...     if len(rejected_contents) > 0:
  ...         # Clean up rejected entry
  ...         shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(rejected_dir, leafname))
  ...         print "Rejected uploads: %s" % rejected_contents
  ...         return
  ...
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(failed_dir)) == 0, (
  ...         "Failed upload(s): %s" % os.listdir(failed_dir))
  ...     if is_new:
  ...         process_new(distro=distro, series=series)
  ...     process_accepted(distro=distro)
  ...     assert simple_publish(distro=distro), (
  ...             "Should publish at least one item")
  ...     if loglevel is None or loglevel <= logging.INFO:
  ...         print "Upload complete."

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.mail_helpers import pop_notifications
  >>> def read_email():
  ...     """Pop all emails from the test mailbox, and summarize them.
  ...
  ...     For each message, prints "To:" followed by recipients; "Subject:"
  ...     followed by subject line; and message body followed by a blank line.
  ...     """
  ...     for message in pop_notifications(commit=False):
  ...         print "To:", message['to']
  ...         print "Subject:", message['subject']
  ...         print message.get_payload()
  ...         print ''

The 'bar' package' is an arch-all package. We have four stages to the
bar test. Each stage should be simple enough. First we have a new
source, then a new binary, then an overridable source and then an
overridable binary. This tests the simple overriding of both sources
and arch-independent binaries.

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-1', is_new=True, loglevel=logging.INFO)
  log> Processing upload
  ...
  Upload complete.

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-1_binary', is_new=True)

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-2')

Check the rejection of bar_1.0-2_binary when uploaded to the wrong build id.

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'bar_1.0-2_binary', upload_policy="buildd", build_id="2",
  ...     loglevel=logging.ERROR)
  log> Exception while accepting:
  Attempt to upload binaries specifying build 2, where they don't fit.
  ...
  Rejected uploads: ['bar_1.0-2_binary']

Try it again without the bogus build id.  This succeeds without
complaints.

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-2_binary')

Check the rejection of a malicious version of bar package which refers
to a different 'bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz'.

  >>> stub.test_emails = []
  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-3', loglevel=logging.ERROR)
  Rejected uploads: ['bar_1.0-3']

  >>> read_email()
  To:
      Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>,
      Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>
  Subject: bar_1.0-3_source.changes rejected
  ...

Check the rejection (instead of failure) of an upload to a series or
pocket which does not exist. We use the security upload policy for easier
testing, as unsigned uploads are allowed.

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'unstable_1.0-1', upload_policy="security", loglevel=logging.ERROR)
  Rejected uploads: ['unstable_1.0-1']

  >>> read_email()
  To: Celso Providelo <celso.providelo@canonical.com>
  Subject: unstable_1.0-1_source.changes rejected
  Rejected:
  Unable to find distroseries: unstable
  ...

Force weird behavior with rfc2047 sentences containing '.' on
bar_1.0-4, which caused bug # 41102.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> name16 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
  >>> name16.displayname = "Foo B. Bar"
  >>> syncUpdate(name16)

Check the email recipient for displayname containing special chars,
'.', must be rfc2047 compliant:

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-4')
  >>> uninteresting_email = stub.test_emails.pop()
  >>> read_email()
  To:
    "Foo B. Bar" <foo.bar@canonical.com>,
    Celso Providelo <celso.providelo@canonical.com>
  Subject: [ubuntutest/breezy-RELEASE] bar 1.0-4 (Accepted)
  ...

Revert changes:

  >>> name16.displayname = "Foo Bar"
  >>> syncUpdate(name16)

Check if we forcibly add the changer as recipient for "sync" uploads,
which contains unsigned changesfile. Ensure it sends email to the
changer.

  >>> stub.test_emails = []

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-5', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> read_email()
  To: Celso Providelo <celso.providelo@canonical.com>
  Subject: [ubuntutest/breezy-RELEASE] bar 1.0-5 (Accepted)
  ...


Add a new series of bar sourcepackage, rename its binary package to
'bar-bin', upload the binary and look for a spurious sourcepackagename
created with the binary package name.

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-6', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-6_binary', is_new=True)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISourcePackageNameSet
  >>> spn_set = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
  >>> assert spn_set.queryByName('bar-bin') is None


== Source Uploads using epochs ==

As described in Debian Policy
(http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html)

A package version can be provided as:

[epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision]

The 'epoch' allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of
a package, and also a package's previous version numbering schemes,
to be left behind.

In few words, it is another mechanism to override upstream version
scheme changes and keep the package sanely versioned.

For instance, if upstream "bar" switched their versioning from
date-based to version based.

An old version '20050304' will always higher than '0.1.2'.

So, when such thing happens, the package maintainer added the epoch to
get '1:0.1.2' which is higher than '20050304', since the epoch is
implied as '0'.

Check if upload system interpret epochs properly, inter-epoch versions
will get compared in this case (see bug #85201):

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-7', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> read_email()
  To: ...
  Subject: [ubuntutest/breezy-RELEASE] bar 1.0-6 (Accepted)
  ...

  >>> simulate_upload('bar_1.0-8', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> read_email()
  To: ...
  Subject: [ubuntutest/breezy-RELEASE] bar 1:1.0-8 (Accepted)
  ...

== Pocket Version Consistency ==

Check behaviour of upload system for uploads across pockets (see
bug #34089, #58144 and #83976 for further info)

Let's start a new package series by uploading foo_1.0-1  source in
ubututest/breezy-RELEASE:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_1.0-1', upload_policy='sync', is_new=True,
  ...     loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> NEW: foo_1.0.orig.tar.gz
  log> NEW: foo_1.0-1.diff.gz
  log> NEW: foo_1.0-1.dsc
  ...
  log> Distribution: breezy
  ...
  Upload complete.

And its binary:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_1.0-1_i386_binary', upload_policy='anything', is_new=True,
  ...     loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> foo: (binary) NEW
  ...
  Upload complete.

Set ubuntutest/breezy as the "current series" to activate post-release
pockets.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import DistroSeriesStatus
  >>> breezy.status = DistroSeriesStatus.CURRENT
  >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn.commit()

Since we are using 'sync' policy in the following tests the packages
are auto-approved, however, in the real environment the 'insecure'
policy will be used which force packages to wait for approval in the
UNAPPROVED queue.

Upload a newer version of source package "foo" to breezy-backports:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_2.9-1', upload_policy='sync', loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> OK: foo_2.9.orig.tar.gz
  log> OK: foo_2.9-1.diff.gz
  log> OK: foo_2.9-1.dsc
  log> -> Component: universe Section: devel
  ...
  log> Distribution: breezy-backports
  ...
  Upload complete.


In order to verify if the binary ancestry lookup algorithm works we
will need to build a new DistroArchSeries for powerpc in
ubuntutest/breezy.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     ProcessorFamily, Processor)
  >>> powerpc_pf = ProcessorFamily.selectOneBy(name='powerpc')
  >>> powerpc_proc = Processor(family=powerpc_pf, name='powerpc',
  ...                          title='PowerPC G3/G4', description='G3/G4')
  >>> powerpc_dar = breezy.newArch('powerpc', powerpc_pf, True, breezy.owner)

After having the respective DistroArchSeries in place we will submit a
binary upload for the last source in BACKPORTS. The ancestry should be
found in i386/RELEASE, because it's the only one available.

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_2.9-1_binary', upload_policy='anything',
  ...     loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> Checking for foo/2.9-1/powerpc binary ancestry
  log> foo-1.0-1 (binary) exists in i386/RELEASE
  ...
  Upload complete.


Due the constraints relaxation requested by bug #83976, even having
foo_2.9-1 as the current version in BACKPORTS, we should be able to
upload foo_2.9-2 to UPDATES. If it strongly affects the users' system
it should be rejected by the package reviewer, otherwise people can
live with this inconsistency.

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_2.9-2', upload_policy='sync', loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> OK: foo_2.9-2.diff.gz
  log> OK: foo_2.9-2.dsc
  log> -> Component: universe Section: devel
  ...
  log> Distribution: breezy-updates
  ...
  Upload complete.

Same behaviour is expected for a version in SECURITY lower than that
in PROPOSED:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_2.9-4', upload_policy='sync', loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> OK: foo_2.9-4.diff.gz
  log> OK: foo_2.9-4.dsc
  log> -> Component: universe Section: devel
  ...
  log> Distribution: breezy-proposed
  ...
  Upload complete.

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_2.9-3', upload_policy='sync', loglevel=logging.DEBUG)
  log> ...
  log> OK: foo_2.9-3.diff.gz
  log> OK: foo_2.9-3.dsc
  log> -> Component: universe Section: devel
  ...
  log> Distribution: breezy-security
  ...
  Upload complete.

However, the source upload of a smaller version than the one already
published inside the target pocket should be rejected:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'foo_1.0-3', upload_policy='sync', loglevel=logging.INFO)
  log> ...
  log> Upload was rejected:
  log> foo_1.0-3.dsc: Version older than that in the archive. 1.0-3 <= 2.9-2
  ...
  Rejected uploads: ['foo_1.0-3']

Note that the ancestry pointed in the rejection message (2.9-2) is what
we expect.

Set ubuntutest/breezy to 'experimental' state again to not affect the
rest of the test:

  >>> breezy.status = DistroSeriesStatus.EXPERIMENTAL
  >>> breezy.syncUpdate()


== Staged Security Uploads ==

Perform a staged (source-first) security upload, simulating a run of
the buildd-queuebuilder inbetween, to verify fix for bug 53437. To be
allowed a security upload, we need to use a released distroseries,
eg ubuntu/warty.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.section import (
  ...     Section, SectionSelection)
  >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
  >>> devel = Section.selectOneBy(name="devel")
  >>> ss = SectionSelection(distroseries=warty, section=devel)

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'baz_1.0-1', is_new=True, upload_policy="security",
  ...     series="warty-security", distro="ubuntu")

Check there's a SourcePackageRelease with no build.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageRelease, SourcePackageName, Build)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingPocket
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BuildStatus
  >>> spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name="baz")
  >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  >>> spr_id = spr.id
  >>> builds = Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id)
  >>> len(list(builds))
  0

Manually create a build for this spr in i386.  This simulates the
buildd-queuebuilder having run inbetween the source and binary uploads.

  >>> warty_i386 = ubuntu['warty']['i386']
  >>> main_archive = ubuntu.main_archive
  >>> build = spr.createBuild(warty_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY,
  ...                         main_archive, status=BuildStatus.NEEDSBUILD)

Check build created

  >>> len(list(Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id)))
  1

Upload the i386 binary:

  >>> simulate_upload(
  ...     'baz_1.0-1_single_binary', is_new=True, upload_policy="security",
  ...     distro="ubuntu", series="warty-security")

Should still just have one build, and it should now be FULLYBUILT.

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import clear_current_connection_cache
  >>> clear_current_connection_cache()

  >>> builds = list(Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id))
  >>> len(builds)
  1
  >>> builds[0].buildstate == BuildStatus.FULLYBUILT
  True


Regression test for bug 54039. Currently must be here, see bug 54158.

In bug 54039, we were rewriting all Release files, at a time when, in
unchanged pockets, the uncompressed Sources and Packages files would
be missing, having been deleted at the end of the previous publisher
run. Rewriting the Release files with these files missing produces a
broken distro.

We will make two publisher runs, deleting the uncompressed index files
inbetween, and verify that the second publisher run doesn't screw up the
release files in the way bug-54039 infected code would.

First a couple helpers.

  >>> import os
  >>> import stat

First publish the distro carefully, to get everything in place.
Before this can happen we need to set up some dummy librarian files for
files that are published in the sample data.

  >>> fillLibrarianFile(66)
  >>> fillLibrarianFile(67)
  >>> fillLibrarianFile(68)
  >>> fillLibrarianFile(70)

  >>> run_publish_distro(careful=True)
  DEBUG   Initialising zopeless.

Delete the uncompressed Packages and Sources files from the archive folder.
This simulates what cron.daily does between publishing runs.

  >>> os.system('find /var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest \\( -name "Packages" '
  ...           '-o -name "Sources" \\) -exec rm "{}" \\;')
  0

Record the timestamp of a release file we expect to be rewritten,
which we'll need later.

  >>> release_timestamp = os.stat('/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/'
  ...     'breezy/Release')[stat.ST_MTIME]

Re-publish the distribution, with careful publishing only. This will mean
only pockets into which we've done some publication will have apt-ftparchive
work done.

Check that breezy-autotest is skipped, to ensure that changes to what's
uploaded in the test above don't break the assumptions of this test.

  >>> run_publish_distro(careful_publishing=True)
  DEBUG   Initialising zopeless.
  INFO      Distribution: ubuntutest

Check the breezy-security release file doesn't exhibit bug 54039.

  >>> release_file_has_uncompressed_packages(
  ...     '/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/breezy-security/Release')
  True

We also need to check the fix for bug 54039 didn't go too far, ie. that
Release files are still generated for those pockets where they should be.
So, check the MTIME has changed for hoary-test/Release.

  >>> new_release_timestamp = os.stat('/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/'
  ...     'breezy/Release')[stat.ST_MTIME]

  >>> new_release_timestamp == release_timestamp
  False



Nice! That's enough for now.. let's kill the process and clean
everything up.

  >>> shutil.rmtree("/var/tmp/archive/")
  >>> shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)

  >>> ZecaTestSetup().tearDown()
