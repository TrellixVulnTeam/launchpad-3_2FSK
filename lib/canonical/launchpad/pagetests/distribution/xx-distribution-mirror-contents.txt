== Mirror contents ==

After a mirror is probed, we display its mirrored contents, together with
the "freshness" of each content.

For archive mirrors we have a table listing the arch releases mirrored and
another one for the source releases mirrored.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/ubuntu/+mirror/archive-mirror2')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/ubuntu/+mirror/archive-mirror2'

  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...This mirror was last verified...
  ...Versions and architectures mirrored...
  ...Hoary Hedgehog ...i386...One hour behind...
  ...Warty Warthog ...i386...Two hours behind...
  ...Source code mirrored...
  ...Hoary Hedgehog ...Up to date...
  ...Warty Warthog ...Six hours behind...

For release mirrors, we have a single table listing the releases and
flavours mirrored.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/ubuntu/+mirror/releases-mirror2')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/ubuntu/+mirror/releases-mirror2'

  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...This mirror was last verified...
  ...Versions and flavours mirrored...
  ...Hoary Hedgehog...Ubuntu...Edubuntu...
  ...Warty Warthog...Ubuntu...Kubuntu...


== Sources.list entries ==

We include in the distribution mirror page a control which allows
generating apt sources.list entries for each series for which we have
mirror contents 

    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/ubuntu/+mirror/archive-mirror2')
    >>> results = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'sources-list-entries')
    >>> text = extract_text(results)
    >>> print text
    deb http://localhost:11375/valid-mirror2/ YOUR_DISTRO_SERIES_HERE main
    deb-src http://localhost:11375/valid-mirror2/ YOUR_DISTRO_SERIES_HERE main

and the select control that lets you update them:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'series-widget-div')
    <div id="series-widget-div">
    ...
    <select id="field.series" name="field.series" size="1"
            onchange="updateSeries(this);">
      <option value="none">Choose a Distribution series</option>
      <option value="hoary">The Hoary Hedgehog Release</option>
      <option value="warty">The Warty Warthog Release</option>
    </select>
    ...
