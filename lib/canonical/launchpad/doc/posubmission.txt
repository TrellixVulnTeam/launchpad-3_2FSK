POSubmission
============

This class links the translations submitted by a translator with the associated.

deleteMe
--------

With this method, we allow to remove a submission.

We will need extra permissions to use this method.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.harness import LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup
    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup(dbuser='rosettaadmin').setUp()

It needs that there are no references to it to be able to remove it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POSubmission
    >>> posubmission = POSubmission.get(1)
    >>> posubmission.deleteMe()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IntegrityError:...

Restore the database access after the failure.

    >>> transaction.abort()

Let's retry with a submission that we know is not referenced.

    >>> posubmission = POSubmission.get(693)
    >>> posubmission.deleteMe()

It should not exist now.

    >>> posubmission = POSubmission.get(693)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SQLObjectNotFound:...

    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup().tearDown()
