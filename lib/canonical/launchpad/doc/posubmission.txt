= POSubmissionSet =

This class represents the set of POSubmission objects in our database.
We use it to get a concrete submission when we know its ID.

Let's do some imports we will need to test this class.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPOSubmissionSet
  >>> posubmissionset = getUtility(IPOSubmissionSet)

== getPOSubmissionByID ==

With this method, we can get the POSubmission object that has the given
id as argument or None when it doesn't exist.

We can get a POSubmission object that exists.

  >>> posubmission = posubmissionset.getPOSubmissionByID(1)
  >>> posubmission is None
  False
  >>> posubmission.id
  1

And we get None when there isn't any POSubmission with the given ID.

  >>> posubmission = posubmissionset.getPOSubmissionByID(100000)
  >>> posubmission is None
  True
