    <h1>The Launchpad Registry</h1>

    <p>This is where we catalogue
    all the open source projects registered in The Launchpad.
    We urge you to register your open source
    project with The Launchpad.</p>

    <h2>Open Source Products</h2>

    <p>The Launchpad includes information on hundreds of applications that
    are part of the open source universe. For each of these applications it
    is usually possible to file bugs, help to translate the application and
    review the application's source code using Bazaar. These links allow you
    to find or register an open source product in the Launchpad:</p>

	<ul>

      <li><a href="/products/">Find Product</a>: find your open source
      product if it has been registered in The Launchpad.</li>

      <li><a href="/products/+new">Register Product</a>: register an open
      source product with The Launchpad.</li>

      <li><a href="/products/+all">All Products</a>: see a complete list
      of all open source products registered with The Launchpad.</li>

	</ul>

    <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

    <p>The Registry also knows about broader open source projects which
    might be responsible for multiple products. For example, the Mozilla
    Project publishes several open source products, such as Thunderbird and
    Firefox and Sunbird, not to mention Gecko and other libraries. A Project
    is a distinct group of people who work together on a set of (usually
    related) products.</p>

    <ul>
   
      <li><a href="/projects/">Find your project</a> if it has been
      registered in Launchpad already.</li>

      <li><a href="/projects/+new">Register an open source project</a>
      in Launchpad.</li>

      <li><a href="/projects/+all">Show all projects</a> currently registered
      in Launchpad.</li>

    </ul>
