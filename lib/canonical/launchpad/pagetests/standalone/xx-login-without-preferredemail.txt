  'salgado' doesn't have a preferred email address. He can't login without
  first validating his email address.

  ...The email address 'guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', which you're...
  ...trying to use to login has not yet been validated to use in Launchpad...
  ...We sent an email to that address with instructions on how to confirm...
  ...that it belongs to you...
  ...


  When this happens, we automatically send an email to that address so the
  user can validate it and login.

  >>> import email
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()

  Check if the email was sent to the right address.

  >>> to_addrs
  ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com']
