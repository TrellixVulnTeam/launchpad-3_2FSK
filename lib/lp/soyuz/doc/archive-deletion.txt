= Deleting an archive =

When deleting an archive, the user calls IArchive.delete(), passing in
the IPerson who is requesting the deletion.

All of the publishing records will be marked as DELETED, the archive is
disabled and the status is set to DELETING.

This status tells the publisher to then delete the repository area.  Once
it completes that task it will set the status to DELETED.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.archive import (
    ...     ArchiveStatus, IArchiveSet, IArchive)
    >>> from lp.soyuz.tests.test_publishing import SoyuzTestPublisher
    >>> login("admin@canonical.com")
    >>> stp = SoyuzTestPublisher()
    >>> stp.prepareBreezyAutotest()
    >>> archive = factory.makeArchive()

The archive is currently active:

    >>> print archive.enabled
    True

    >>> print archive.status.name
    ACTIVE

We can create some packages in it using the test publisher:

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.publishing import PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> ignore = stp.getPubBinaries(
    ...     archive=archive, binaryname="foo-bin1",
    ...     status=PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    >>> ignore = stp.getPubBinaries(
    ...     archive=archive, binaryname="foo-bin2",
    ...     status=PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    >>> ignore = stp.getPubBinaries(
    ...     archive=archive, binaryname="foo-bin3",
    ...     status=PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    >>> from storm.store import Store
    >>> Store.of(archive).flush()

Calling delete() will now do the deletion.  It is only callable by someone
with launchpad.Edit permission on the archive.  Here, "duderino" who is
some random dude is refused:

    >>> person = factory.makePerson(name="duderino")
    >>> login_person(person)
    >>> archive.delete(person)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

However we can delete it using the owner of the archive:

    >>> login_person(archive.owner)
    >>> archive.delete(archive.owner)

    >>> Store.of(archive).invalidate()
    >>> publications = list(archive.getPublishedSources())
    >>> publications.extend(list(archive.getAllPublishedBinaries()))
    >>> for pub in publications:
    ...     if pub.status != PackagePublishingStatus.DELETED:
    ...         print "%s is %s and not deleted!" % (
    ...             pub.displayname, pub.status.name)

    >>> print archive.enabled
    False

    >>> print archive.status.name
    DELETING
