BuildFarmJobBehavior
====================

The Launchpad build farm was originally designed for building binary
packages from source packages, but was subsequently generalised to support
other types of build farm jobs.

The `BuildFarmJobBehavior` class encapsulates job-type-specific behavior
with a standard interface to which our generic IBuilder class delegates.
The result is that neither our generic IBuilder class or any call-sites
(such as the build master) need any knowledge of different job types or
how to handle them.
