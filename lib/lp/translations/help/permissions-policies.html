    <h1>Translation permission policies</h1>

    <p>
      Each project and distribution can choose what they feel to be the right
      mix of openness and control for their translations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Launchpad offers four permission policies:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open:</strong> anyone can submit translations directly to
          your project in Launchpad. Great for encouraging drive-by
          contributions.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured:</strong> if your project's translation group has
          assigned an individual or team to a particular language, only that
          person or members of that team can review and accept translation
          strings for that language. Anyone can suggest a translation for
          those languages, though. For languages that aren't covered by a
          translation group, anyone can directly submit a translation.</li>
      <li><strong>Restricted:</strong> ideal if your priority is to manage
           translation quality, or if translation to some languages is managed
           elsewhere. It is similar to Structured. However, the ability to
           translate is unavailable for those languages that don't have an
           individual or team assigned to it within the translation group.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Closed:</strong> only people or teams appointed in the
          translation group can suggest or make translations. Translation is
          closed to everyone else. This is ideal if your project requires an
          agreement to transfer copyright before starting work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Make your translations count!  Unless you're just making a quick
      correction, you should get in touch with the project's translation
      community before you start work. That way you can learn where your help
      is most needed, what words they use to translate common terms and what
      gives your translations the best chance of being approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow the link to the project's translations group to contact them.
