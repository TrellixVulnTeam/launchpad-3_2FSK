= Pulling and Scanning =

First, launch the server:
  $ make run_all

Run the puller to flush all the crap sample data branches:
  $ ./cronscripts/supermirror-pull.py upload
  
Then, push a branch:
  $ bzr push bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/...

Run the puller:
  $ ./cronscripts/supermirror-pull.py upload

Build the rewrite map:
  $ mkdir -p /var/tmp/sm-ng/config
  $ ./cronscripts/supermirror_rewritemap.py \
      /var/tmp/sm-ng/config/launchpad-lookup.txt

Run the scanner:
  $ ./cronscripts/branch-scanner.py


= Issues =

 - Currently have bazaar.launchpad.dev on a separate IP from the rest of LP.
 - Shouldn't have to mkdir as part of process
 - Bunch of junk rows in DB, cause supermirror-pull to spit lots of crap.
 - supermirror_rewritemap.py assumes location shared by apache config.
 - Get apache config into rf-setup
 - 'upload' sucks, say 'hosted' instead.
