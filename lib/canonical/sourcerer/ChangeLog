2004-07-26 19:10:27 GMT	Scott James Remnant <scott@canonical.com>	patch-7

    Summary:
      sort tar and patch contents before processing
    Revision:
      sourcerer--devel--0--patch-7

    Debian generally add sequence numbers to the start of tarballs and patches,
    so sort the list of filenames before processing so we take them into
    account.

2004-07-26 19:08:55 GMT	Scott James Remnant <scott@canonical.com>	patch-6

    Summary:
      compare length of entry/item dirname
    Revision:
      sourcerer--devel--0--patch-6

    When source packages change layout one of the major things that changes
    is the number of directory components in the dirname of the patch or
    tarball.  This means the branches no longer match up with what's in the
    source package, so we shouldn't match the manifest entry.

2004-07-26 18:37:17 GMT	Scott James Remnant <scott@canonical.com>	patch-5

    Summary:
      track and use original filenames for patch matching
    Revision:
      sourcerer--devel--0--patch-5

    Some packages (bash) have the product name in the old filename part
    of the patch, and not the new.
    
    For these we now keep the old filenames as well, and if we can't
    match against the new filenames try again with the old ones (setting
    basename appropriately).

2004-07-26 18:14:37 GMT	Scott James Remnant <scott@canonical.com>	patch-3

    Summary:
      fix move failures
    Revision:
      sourcerer--devel--0--patch-3

    Factor out copyChanges() into separate functions and change the order
    in which they are called.
    
    fileUpdate() is called first, this can't be affected by either adds or
    deletes.
    
    fileDelete() is called next, and this also processes anything that needs
    to be moved out of the directory that's about to be deleted.
    
    fileAdd() is called next, these need to happen after deletes in case files
    are exchanged.
    
    fileMove() is called last, this needs to be after delete in case files
    are exchanged and after new in case the destination directory is new.
    The case of "before delete" is handled above.

    Summary:
      fix IOError problems
    Revision:
      sourcerer--devel--0--patch-1

    so, I've fixed this bug a dozen times... and I've hopefully finally
    fixed it *this* time.
    
    Check filepath not filename is a symlink, and don't md5sum them.
