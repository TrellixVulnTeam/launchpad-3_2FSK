        <h3>About Launchpad Code Hosting</h3>

        <p>Launchpad works with the Bazaar distributed version control system
           to improve access to your project's code. We believe a distributed
           approach to version control is more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>To help your team find all branches associated with your project,
           Launchpad can mirror any Bazaar branch that's hosted on the
           internet, or host branches directly. A simple web interface lets
           anyone browse your branches' revision histories and you can manage
           upload access with Launchpad's teams infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>For projects that use Subversion or CVS for revision control,
           Launchpad can maintain a continuous import of the development
           trunk into Bazaar. This allows new contributors to work on the
           code, before they get commit access.
