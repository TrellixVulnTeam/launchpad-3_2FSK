"""Code for 'processing' 'uploads'. Also see nascentupload.py.

Uploads are directories in the 'incoming' queue directory. They may have
arrived manually from a distribution contributor, via a poppy upload, or
they may have come from a build.

Within an upload, we may find no changes file, one, or several. One is
the usual number. To process the upload, we process each changes file
in turn.

To process a changes file, we make checks such as that the other files
referenced by it are present, formatting is valid, signatures are correct,
checksums match, and that the .changes file represents an upload which makes
sense, eg. it is not a binary for which we have no source, or an older
version than already exists in the same target distrorelease pocket.

Depending on the outcome of these checks, the changes file will either be
accepted (and the information from it, and the referenced files, imported
into the database) or it won't (and the database will be unchanged). If not
accepted, a changes file might be 'failed' or 'rejected', where failed
changes files are dropped silently, but rejected ones generate a rejection
email back to the uploader.

There are several valid reasons to fail (the changes file is so mangled
that we can't read who we should send a rejection to, or it's not correctly
signed, so we can't be sure a rejection wouldn't be spam (it may not have
been uploaded by who it says it was uploaded by). In practice, in the code
as it stands, we also consider the processing of a changes file to have
failed if it generates an unexpected exception, and there are some known
cases where it does this and a rejection would have been more useful
(see bug 35965).

Each upload directory is saved after processing, in case it is needed for
debugging purposes. This is done by moving it to a directory inside the queue
directory, beside incoming, named after the result - 'failed', 'rejected' or
'accepted'. Where there are no changes files, the upload is considered failed,
and where there is more than one changes file, the upload is assigned the
worst of the results from the various changes files found (in the order
above, failed being worst).
