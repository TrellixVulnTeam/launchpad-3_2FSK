= Posting =

Only Launchpad members are allowed to post to team mailing lists.  A message
by a sender who is not a Launchpad member will be summarily discarded.

    # This test requires us to start an SMTP server that accepts messages
    # sent by Mailman's outgoing qrunner and stores these in a Unix mbox.
    >>> import os
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> descriptor, mbox_filename = tempfile.mkstemp()
    >>> os.close(descriptor)

    >>> import itest_helper
    >>> smtpd = itest_helper.SMTPServer(mbox_filename)
    >>> smtpd.start()

    # Create a mailing list for this test.
    >>> import itest_helper
    >>> browser = itest_helper.make_browser()
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people/+newteam')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.name').value = 'itest-one'
    >>> browser.getControl('Display Name').value = 'ITest One'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.subscriptionpolicy').displayValue = [
    ...     'Open Team']
    >>> browser.getControl('Create').click()

XXX BarryWarsaw 06-Dec-2007 The team must be a member of the mailing list beta
program in order to apply for mailing lists.  When mailing lists go public,
this stanza can be removed.

    >>> itest_helper.beta_program_enable('itest-one')

    >>> browser.reload()
    >>> browser.getLink('Configure mailing list').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Apply for Mailing List').click()

    >>> list_one = itest_helper.review_list('itest-one')
    >>> from Mailman.Utils import list_names
    >>> sorted(name for name in list_names() if name.startswith('itest-'))
    ['itest-one']


== Non-member postings ==

Postings from addresses that are not registered and verified with Launchpad
are summarily discarded.

    # Watch Mailman's logs/vette for possible log messages.
    >>> vette_watcher = itest_helper.LogWatcher('vette')

Inject a message from a non-member into Mailman's incoming queue.

    >>> from Mailman.Post import inject
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: zperson@example.net
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <first-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait_for_growth()

To prove that the message was never posted, the mbox file should either be
non-existent or empty.

    >>> itest_helper.get_size(mbox_filename) <= 0
    True


== Unvalidated member postings ==

Similarly, an address that has been registered with Launchpad but not verified
should also be summarily discarded.  To demonstrate this, we'll add Anne as a
normal Launchpad user, but de-certify her alternative address.  This is
equivalent to making it unvalidated.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     get_alternative_email, new_person)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')    
    >>> anne = new_person('Anne')
    >>> alternative_email = get_alternative_email(anne)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> alternative_email.status = EmailAddressStatus.NEW
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> commit()
    >>> print alternative_email.email, alternative_email.statusname
    aperson@example.org New Email Address

    >>> vette_watcher.resync()
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: aperson@example.com
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <second-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a verified member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait_for_growth()

As above, this message got summarily discarded.

    >>> itest_helper.get_size(mbox_filename) <= 0
    True


== Unsubscribed Launchpad members ==

Since Anne's preferred email address is still validated, let's post this
message from that address.  However, because she has not yet joined the team
or subscribed to its mailing list, she still can't post to it.

    >>> print anne.preferredemail.email, anne.preferredemail.statusname
    anne.person@example.com Preferred Email Address
    >>> smtp_watcher = itest_helper.LogWatcher('smtp')
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: anne.person@example.com
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: An unsubscribed post
    ... Message-ID: <third-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a member of this team's list (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> smtp_watcher.wait_for_growth()

However, unlike before, a message does show up in the mbox file.  This is the
auto discard notification sent to the team's owner.  The message is discarded
by Mailman's privacy handler because the poster is not a member of the mailing
list.

    >>> messages = list(itest_helper.mbox_iterator(mbox_filename))
    >>> len(messages)
    1
    >>> message = messages[0]
    >>> print message.as_string()
    Subject: Auto-discard notification
    From: itest-one-bounces@launchpad.dev
    To: itest-one-owner@launchpad.dev
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    The attached message has been automatically discarded.
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    From: anne.person@example.com
    To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    Subject: An unsubscribed post

    <BLANKLINE>
    Hi, I am not a member of this team's list (yet).
    ...


== Verified and registered member postings ==

Anne now joins the team and subscribes to the mailing list.  She can now post
to the mailing list.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> team_one = person_set.getByName('itest-one')

    # Subscribe Anne with her preferred address.
    >>> anne.join(team_one)
    >>> list_one.subscribe(anne)
    >>> logout()
    >>> commit()
    >>> itest_helper.wait_for_mailman()

    >>> print anne.preferredemail.email, anne.preferredemail.statusname
    anne.person@example.com Preferred Email Address
    >>> smtp_watcher.resync()
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: anne.person@example.com
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A member post
    ... Message-ID: <fifth-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am now a member of this team's list!
    ... """)
    >>> smtp_watcher.wait_for_growth()

To show that this message will make it through by reading the mbox file.
There are now two messages in the mbox file, the previous auto-discard notice,
and the newly posted message.

    >>> messages = list(itest_helper.mbox_iterator(mbox_filename))
    >>> len(messages)
    2
    >>> message = messages[1]
    >>> print message.as_string()
    From: anne.person@example.com
    To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    Message-ID: <fifth-injection>
    Subject: [Itest-one] A member post
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hi, I am now a member of this team's list!
