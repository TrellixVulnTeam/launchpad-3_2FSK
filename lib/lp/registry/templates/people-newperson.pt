          Launchpad will send a message to the email address you provide
          below.  This message explains that you created a Launchpad profile
          for the email address's owner, and it will include your name and
          email address so that the user can contact you if they want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will not be possible to log in with this new profile, and
          Launchpad will not send any other messages to it before its email
          address is confirmed.  The registration process must be finished by
          the person represented by the new profile.
