Introduction
============

Launchpad can tell you about the code imports that power a branch
if it is an import branch.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

First we create some objects for use in the tests.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> person = factory.makePerson(name='import-owner')
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name='scruff')
    >>> code_import = removeSecurityProxy(factory.makeCodeImport(
    ...    registrant=person, product=product, branch_name='import'))
    >>> no_import_branch = removeSecurityProxy(factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...     owner=person, product=product, name='no-import'))
    >>> logout()

If we query a branch with no import then we find that it tells us
it doesn't have one.

    >>> branch_url = '/' + no_import_branch.unique_name
    >>> response = webservice.get(branch_url)
    >>> representation = response.jsonBody()
    >>> print representation['code_import_link']
    None

For a branch with an import we get a link to the import entry in its
representation.

    >>> branch_url = '/' + code_import.branch.unique_name
    >>> response = webservice.get(branch_url)
    >>> representation = response.jsonBody()
    >>> print representation['code_import_link']
    http://.../~import-owner/scruff/import/+code-import

We can get some information about the import using this URL.

    >>> import_url = representation['code_import_link']
    >>> response = webservice.get(import_url)
    >>> representation = response.jsonBody()
    >>> print representation['self_link'] == import_url
    True
    >>> print representation['owner_link']
    http://.../~import-owner
    >>> print representation['branch_link']
    http://.../~import-owner/scruff/import
    >>> print representation['review_status']
    Pending Review
    >>> print representation['rcs_type']
    Subversion via CSCVS
    >>> print representation['url']
    http://domain9.domain.com/path10
    >>> print representation['cvs_root']
    None
    >>> print representation['cvs_module']
    None
    >>> print representation['date_last_successful']
    None
