    <title>Getting your way around</title>
    <summary>
      <p>Collaboration is crucial to free software projects.
          Traditionally, it has been difficult for communities to exchange
          information if they use different tools.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout this tour, you'll see how Launchpad's new approach
          solves the problems of collaboration on software projects. By
          bringing together information from different project-specific
          sources and helping communities to organise themselves into teams,
          Launchpad helps different projects to collaborate on common
          problems, such as bugs in shared code.
      </p>
      <p>Let's start with finding your way around the interface.</p>

    <callout top="" left="">The Actions menu gives you different options,
      depending on which application you're using.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">You can find additional information in the

    <summary>Launchpad makes it easy to find out what work someone is involved
      in. Each individual's home page shows their team memberships, the
      projects that they're most active in and their contact details.
    </summary>

    <callout top="" left="">Knowing who you're working with is an important
      part of community building and may help you find people to collaborate
      with. Each Launchpad user can post a short description of themselves and
      a photo.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">Launchpad shows you which projects a user is most
      active in and the Launchpad applications they've used for those
      projects.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">Similarly, you can see all the teams that a person
      has joined.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">It's important to be able to contact people you
      want to work with. Launchpad shows you how to contact them and where
      to find a wiki page with more information.

      <p>Strong communities are built on teams. Launchpad helps communities to
        develop rich structures, through the spontaneous creation of teams
        around projects and initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>Anyone can create a team and you can use them just about anywhere
        that you'd use an individual: for example, as a member of another
        team, as a project's bug contact or to access a shared Bazaar branch.
      </p>
    </summary>
    <callout top="" left="">Your team's description is an important way to let
      potential members know what the team plans to do and how it is
      organised.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">You can choose from three membership policies for
      your team. Open membership means anyone can join, anyone can apply to a
      moderated team but a team administrator must approve their membership
      and restricted teams are invitation-only.
    </callout>
    <callout top="" left="">Teams can own teams and be a member of other
      teams. The row of small icons shows which other teams this team belongs
      to.
