= Linking Revisions to Bugs =

XXX - rationale
XXX - explain database layout
XXX - explain how relation is created
XXX - explain 'superfluous' branch reference

It's very common for coders to want to say that a revision fixes a bug.

== Creating a link from a revision to a bug ==

XXX - We want to make this sample data actually be consistent. The revision
number we give should actually be a revision in the branch we give. It would
also be nice if the bug is on the product that the branch is on.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugBranchRevisionSet
  >>> bug_revisions = getUtility(IBugBranchRevisionSet)
  >>> bbr = bug_revisions.new(bug=1, branch=1, revision=1)
  >>> bbr.bug.id
  1
  >>> bbr.branch.id
  1
  >>> bbr.revision.id
  1


== Loading a BugBranchRevision link ==

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import BugBranchRevision
  >>> bbr2 = BugBranchRevision.get(bbr.id)
  >>> bbr == bbr2
  True
