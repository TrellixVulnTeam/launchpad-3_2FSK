    <h1>There are two ways to initialize a new series:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A continuation of a distribution with existing series. For example,
      after the previous series was released you might want to open a new
      development series by copying the previous one.
      </li>
      <li>A derived distribution series. This is where you have a new
      distribution and you want to copy the packages from a series in a
      different distribution.
      </li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Continuation Series</h2>
     <p>This will copy all the sources and binaries from the previous
         series in the distribution.  Its parent series default to the
         parent series used in the previous series, but they can be changed.
         This is useful, for example, when the new series has a longer
         support period and you wish to sync packages from a more stable
         upstream series.
     </p>
     <p>It will also copy all of the settings from the previous series,
         such as upload permissions and packagesets.</p>

     <h2>New Derived Distribution Series</h2>
     <p>Initializing a new distribution is a complicated task. It takes a
         long time and has a lot of checks. There are various things that
         you need to specify:
         <ul>
           <li>One or more parents to inherit packages from.</li>
           <li>Which architectures available in parents that you want to use</li>
           <li>Which packagesets you want to copy from the parents</li>
           <li>Whether to rebuild the copied packages,
               or copy binaries from the parents.</li>
         </ul>
     </p>
