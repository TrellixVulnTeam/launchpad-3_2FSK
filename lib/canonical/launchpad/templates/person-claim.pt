      If you're <span tal:replace="context/browsername" />, relax! You don't
      need to do anything, and we'll never spam you. But claiming this
      profile will let you edit your contact details, register your own
      projects and code branches in Launchpad, and use Launchpad to
      <strong>collaborate with other developers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To claim the profile, enter one of the e-mail addresses it is
      associated with. (We're not showing you the list of addresses to
      protect <span tal:replace="context/browsername" />'s privacy in case
      you’re someone else.) We’ll e-mail that address to ask your confirmation.
