Soyuz is the part of launchpad that allows for building and managing
derivative Linux distributions.

Views in Zope 3 are things (i.e. classes) that you provide to
templates via ZCML to do some dirty work associated with rendering a
page.

This document describes how to use various view classes in Soyuz page
templates.

  >>> from canonical.soyuz.browser import DistroReleaseSourcesView
  >>> context = request = None
  >>> drsv = DistroReleaseSourcesView(context, request)
  >>> hasattr(drsv, "sourcePackagesBatchNavigator")
  True
