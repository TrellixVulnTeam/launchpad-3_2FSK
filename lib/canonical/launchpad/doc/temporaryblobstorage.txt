Temporary Blob Storage
======================

Launchpad allows users to upload a BLOB, which will be stored for a short
time, before being deleted. This upload can be done anonymously, and the
user is given a "ticket" that is unique and which allows them to point at
that blob during a subsequent transaction.

For example, a system that needs to file a bug, and attach a file to the
bug, could submit a structured BLOB to Launchpad, then start the bug filing
process with a pointer to that BLOB. The bug filing code could then
retrieve, parse and include the contents of the BLOB in the bug report,
perhaps as attachments.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITemporaryStorageManager
    >>> tsm = getUtility(ITemporaryStorageManager)

To create a new TemporaryBlob, use ITemporaryStorageManager.new:

    >>> data = 'abcdefg'
    >>> uuid = tsm.new(data)
    >>> uuid is not None
    True

Because the blob is stored in the Librarian, we cannot retrieve it in the
same transaction as we stored it in:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

To retrieve a blob, we can also use the tsm.

    >>> blob = tsm.fetch(uuid)
    >>> blob.blob
    'abcdefg'

We can delete a blob by UUID too:

    >>> print tsm.delete(uuid)
    None

Size limits can be enforced, although this is turned off by default:

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.launchpad.max_blob_size
    0
    >>> config.launchpad.max_blob_size = 6
    >>> uuid = tsm.new(data)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    BlobTooLarge: 7

    >>> config.launchpad.max_blob_size = 0
