  <p>Being an <em>answer contact</em> is similar to being subscribed to
    <strong>every</strong> questions filed against the context
    (project or sourcepackage) you are an answer contact of.
    You will receive mail notifications about all changes to these questions,
    as well as for every new question created.
  </p>
  <p>You can register as answer contact yourself, or any of the teams you are
    an administrator of. Simply check the appropriate checkbox.
  </p>
  <p>If you don't want to receive notifications anymore, simply remove
    yourself and/or your teams as answer contact by unchecking the
    appropriate checkbox.
  </p>
  <p>Answer contacts must tell Launchpad in which languages they provide help.
     If you have not already set your
    <a
      tal:attributes="href string:${request/lp:person/fmt:url}/+editlanguages"
      >preferred languages</a>, they will be automatically set to your
      browser languages. In the case of a team, only English will be set as 
      the preferred language.
