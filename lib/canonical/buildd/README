In order to build the package you need dpkg-dev and fakeroot

To build the package do:

cd ..../lib/canonical/buildd
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

It will "fail" because the package built in the "wrong" place. Don't worry
about that.

To clean up, do:

fakeroot debian/rules clean
rm launchpad-buildd*deb
rm ../launchpad-buildd*changes
