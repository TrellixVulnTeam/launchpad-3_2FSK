  You can stake a claim to any unclaimed bounty, but must then begin to
  deliver code on a regular schedule, or forfeit the claim to someone else.
  The reviewer will decide when the submission is complete, and can also
  rule that a claimant is making no progress, which will make the bounty
  available again. Payments will be made by Paypal, wire transfer can also
  be made for bounties in excess of $500.
