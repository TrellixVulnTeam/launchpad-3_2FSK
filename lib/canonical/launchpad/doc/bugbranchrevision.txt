= Linking Revisions to Bugs =


== Creating a link from a revision to a bug ==

XXX - We want to make this sample data actually be consistent. The revision
number we give should actually be a revision in the branch we give. It would
also be nice if the bug is on the product that the branch is on.


>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import BugBranchRevision
>>> bbr = BugBranchRevision(bug=1, branch=1, revision=1)
>>> bbr.bug.id
1
>>> bbr.branch.id
1
>>> bbr.revision.id
1
