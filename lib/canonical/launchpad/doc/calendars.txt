Calendars
=========

Some object in the system have calendars.  Actually, currently only persons
(and teams) have calendars, but it is planned to add them to products and
projects, at least.

Calendaring code makes use of the SchoolBell library, which comes from the
SchoolTool project (www.schooltool.org).  Calendars are stored in PostgreSQL
database.

Hooking up calendars to objects
===============================

Objects that have calendars can be adapted to ILaunchpadCalendar.  There is an
adapter registered for ICalendarOwner that returns the 'calendar' attribute of
an object, so the simplest thing for adding a calendar to an object is to
make sure this attribute exists, and declare that the object provides
ICalendarOwner.

There is a view named 'calendar' registered for ICalendarOwner, so if an object
(e.g. a person) that has a calendar can be reached at a certain URL, accessing
the calendar of that object is just a matter of going to URL + '/calendar'.

There is also a view named 'calendar' registered for the root object.  This
view looks up the calendar of the logged-in user.

  XXX Steve Alexander says using views in this fashion is a bad idea (without
      detailing that assertion in great detail), so we have to write custom
      traversers for ICalendarOwners.

There is a set of views available for ICalendar.
