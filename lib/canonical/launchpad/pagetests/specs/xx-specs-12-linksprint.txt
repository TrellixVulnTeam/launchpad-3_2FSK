It is possible to link a specification to a sprint. This pagetest does
that.

The process is a two-step one: first the spec is nominated for the sprint
agenda, and then it is approved. If, however, the person nominating the spec
also has permission to approve it, then it should be approved automatically
for the agenda.

First we open the page for the spec on Support <canvas> objects from the
sample data. We will use Sample Person, who has no special privileges.

  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/products/firefox/+spec/canvas')
  >>> browser.isHtml
  True
  >>> 'Accepted' in browser.contents # make sure the page is not polluted
  False
  >>> 'Proposed' in browser.contents # make sure the page is not polluted
  False

Then we are going to propose it for the meeting agenda:

  >>> browser.getLink('Propose for meeting agenda').click()
  >>> browser.title
  'Put specification on sprint agenda'

Now  with a POST, we try to Add the spec to the Guacamole sprint.

  >>> sprint_field = browser.getControl(name='field.sprint')
  >>> sprint_field.value = ['uds-guacamole']
  >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()
  >>> browser.url # we should have been redirected to the spec page
  'http://.../products/firefox/+spec/canvas'

Now we test to see if the sprint was added correctly to the
specification page.

  >>> 'uds-guacamole' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Accepted' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> 'Proposed' in browser.contents
  True


Sprint Drivers
==============

The control of the sprint agenda is managed by the sprint drivers. These are
the registrant of the sprint, and the designated driver if one has been
assigned. This allows people to register a sprint and have a team of people
who then take charge of the agenda.

In the case above, the spec ended up "proposed". Now we will nominate a spec
to the Paris summit, for which Sample Person is the driver. This time, if we
nominate the spec as Sample Person, it should end up approved immediately.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/distros/kubuntu/+spec/kde-desktopfile-langpacks')
  >>> 'Accepted' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> browser.getLink('Propose for meeting agenda').click()
  >>> sprint_field = browser.getControl(name='field.sprint')
  >>> sprint_field.value = ['paris']
  >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()
  >>> 'paris' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Accepted' in browser.contents
  True
