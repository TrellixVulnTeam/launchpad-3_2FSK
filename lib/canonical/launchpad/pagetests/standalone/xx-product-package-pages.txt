Launchpad can show you a product's packages by distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+distributions HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
    <h1>Packages by distribution</h1>
  ...
      <h2>Ubuntu Linux</h2>
  ...

It can also show the packages by product series. And if you have permission (for
example, you're the owner of the product), Launchpad lets you register packages
for each series. In this case, mark@hbd.com is the owner of Evolution.

    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser

    >>> evo_owner = Browser()
    >>> evo_owner.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic mark@hbd.com:test')
    >>> evo_owner.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+packages')
    >>> evo_owner.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+packages'
    >>> print evo_owner.contents
    <...
    ...<h1>Distribution packages</h1>
    ...
    ...trunk...
    ...
    >>> evo_owner.getLink(url='http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/trunk/+addpackage') is not None
    True

If you're not the owner or an admin, you still see the packages, but without
the link to add packages yourself.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+packages')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+packages'
    >>> print browser.contents
    <...
    ...<h1>Distribution packages</h1>...
    ...
    >>> browser.getLink(url='http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/trunk/+addpackage')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

If there are no product series, Launchpad invites you to create a series.
