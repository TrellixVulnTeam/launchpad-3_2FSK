  On sabdfl's personal page, it's possible to see, amongst other things, his
  preferred email address (if you're logged in).

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/sabdfl HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Mark Shuttleworth...
  ...Confirmed e-mail addresses...
  ...mark@hbd.com...


  In the case of name12, that's not possible (even if you're logged in) because 
  he wants us to hide his email addresses.

  >>> name12_page = http(r"""
  ... GET /people/name12 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """).getBody()

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
  >>> name12 = Person.get(12)
  >>> name12.preferredemail.email
  u'test@canonical.com'

  >>> str(name12.preferredemail.email) in name12_page
  False
