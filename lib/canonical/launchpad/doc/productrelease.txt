ProductRelease
==============

A ProductSeries can have multiple releases.  Apache2 (a ProductSeries)
can have ProductReleases 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.1, etc.
>>> from zope.component import getUtility
>>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
...     IPersonSet, IProductSeries, IProductSet, NotFoundError, IProjectSet)
>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates

First, get a product that has some ProductSeries in the sample data.

>>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
>>> firefox = productset['firefox']

A ProductSeries can be retrieved using the associated product and the
series name.

>>> trunk = firefox.getSeries('trunk')

Get the product releases for trunk.


>>> releases = trunk.releases
>>> releases.count()
3

>>> rel = releases[0]

Get the default view for the release
>>> from zope.app.zapi import getView
>>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
>>> req = LaunchpadTestRequest()
>>> rel_view = getView(rel, '+adddownloadfile', req)
>>> import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
>>> rel_view.context.getURL()
