  View Classes for Launchpad Classes

  This directory should hold View Classes for the core objects in launchpad,
  EXCEPT for the real app-specific stuff that belongs in canonical/malone and
  canonical/rosetta and canonical/soyuz etc.

  So ProductView belongs here, but RegistryApplicationView belongs in
  canonical.malone.browser.py
