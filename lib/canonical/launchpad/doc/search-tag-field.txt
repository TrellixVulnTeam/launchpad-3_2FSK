= SearchTag fields =

SearchTag supports validating a superset of Tag, to support a rich set
of options when searching for tags.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import SearchTag, Tag

    >>> tag = Tag()
    >>> search_tag = SearchTag()

Just as with a Tag, a plain name is fine.

    >>> tag.validate(u'fred')
    >>> search_tag.validate(u'fred')

Names prefixed with an exclamation mark are allowed. This denotes a
search request for the absense of a tag.

    >>> tag.validate(u'!fred')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ConstraintNotSatisfied: !fred

    >>> search_tag.validate(u'!fred')

Wildcards are also allowed. At the moment, only testing for the
presence or absense of tags is allowed, rather than substring
searches.

    >>> tag.validate(u'*')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ConstraintNotSatisfied: *

    >>> search_tag.validate(u'*')

    >>> tag.validate(u'!*')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ConstraintNotSatisfied: !*

    >>> search_tag.validate(u'*')
