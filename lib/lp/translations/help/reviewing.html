    <h1>Reviewing translations</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> You can find the translation guidelines
      you must follow as a reviewer by visiting the appropriate
      translation group from the <a href="/+groups/" target="_blank">
      translation group overview page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a member of one or more translation teams, you can help make
      sure that that the work of other translators makes it into
      published software.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the quickest ways is to review translated strings in the
      languages with which you're familiar. The more reviews you do, the
      more software will be available in the languages you care about.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get started, simply follow the review links on your
      <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/people/+me/" target="_blank">
      translation dashboard</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> there's a lot more to being a member of
      a translation team than just reviewing strings. Most translation
      teams have an active community that works to set standards and
      divide up work among its members.
