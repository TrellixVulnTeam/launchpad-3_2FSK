Adding projects
===============

Sample Person decides to register her new project, which she can do either
from the Launchpad home page or the projects home page.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Create a new project').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Register a project in Launchpad

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/projects')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Register a project').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Register a project in Launchpad

The page includes both a direct link and a button to order Ubuntu CDs.

    >>> print user_browser.getLink('shipit.ubuntu.com').url
    https://shipit.ubuntu.com/
    >>> print user_browser.getControl('Oh, I want Ubuntu CDs').type
    submit


Project basics
--------------

Sample Person doesn't want Ubuntu CDs, she wants to register her new project.
This is done in two steps.  First, Sample Person provides some basic
information about her project, such as its name, final URL component, title,
and summary.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Name').value = 'Aardvark Center'

She makes some mistakes though, entering illegal characters for the URL, and
forgetting to enter a title or summary.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('URL').value = 'aard vark'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> print_errors(user_browser.contents)
    There are 3 errors.
    URL:
    http://launchpad.net/
    Invalid name 'aard vark'. Names must start with a letter or
    number and be lowercase. The characters +,
    - and . are also allowed after the
    first character.
    At least one lowercase letter or number, followed by letters, numbers,
    dots, hyphens or pluses. Keep this name short; it is used in URLs as
    shown above.
    Title:
    Required input is missing.
    The project title. Should be just a few words.
    Summary:
    Required input is missing.
    The summary should be a single short paragraph.

Realizing her mistake, Sample Person fills out the project's basic information
correctly this time.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('URL').value = 'aardvark'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Title').value = 'The Aardvark Center'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     'A project designed to placate ornery aardvarks')

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

The project is not yet created; instead, the project basics are successfully
validated and the second step of the process is entered.

    >>> print user_browser.title
    Register a project in Launchpad


Completing the registration
---------------------------

The second step of the registration process does not allow Sample Person to
modify the project's URL.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('URL')
    <Control name='field.name' type='hidden'>
    >>> print user_browser.getControl('URL').value
    aardvark

Sample Person is given the opportunity though to change the title and
summary.  She can also add a longer description.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Title').value = 'Aardvark Central Command'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     'Control pesky aardvarkian fnords')
    ... user_browser.getControl('Description').value = (
    ...     'The desktop aardvark is an ornery thing.')

Before a project can be created though, a license for it must be selected.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Complete Registration').click()
    >>> print_errors(user_browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
    ...
    You must select at least one license. If you select Other/Proprietary or
    Other/OpenSource you must include a description of the license.

This time, Sample Person remembers to select a license.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Python License').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Complete Registration').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Aardvark Central Command in Launchpad


Search results
--------------

Sample Person has another project she wants to register.  It is similar to
Firefox.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Create a new project').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Register a project in Launchpad

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Name').value = 'Snowdog'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('URL').value = 'snowdog'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Title').value = 'Snowdog Browser'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     'Snowdog is a browser similar to Firefox')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

A search is performed using the terms in the URL, title, and summary.  The
Firefox project is discovered.

Instead of registering her new project, Sample Person decides to participate
in the Mozilla Project.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('the Mozilla Project').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    The Mozilla Project in Launchpad


Redirecting
-----------

The project registration workflow used to get started at
/projects/+new-guided.  To prevent bitrot, we redirect that URL to the new
location at /projects/+new.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/projects/+new-guided')
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Register a project in Launchpad
    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/projects/+new
