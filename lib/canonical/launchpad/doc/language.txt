    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> language_set = getUtility(ILanguageSet)

We can get hold of languages by their language code.

    >>> language = language_set['es']
    >>> language.englishname
    u'Spanish'

We can convert language codes to standard form.

    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt')
    'pt'
    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt_BR')
    'pt_BR'
    >>> language_set.canonicalise_language_code('pt-br')
    'pt_BR'

We can even get hold of many at once. Language codes will be converted to
standard form and unknown codes will be ignored.

    >>> languages = language_set.codes_to_languages(['es', 'pt_BR', 'zz'])
    >>> [language.englishname for language in languages]
    [u'Spanish', u'Portuguese (Brazil)']
