Distro Releases
===============

From the DerivationOverview spec[1]:

    A distribution of GNU/Linux comprises a set of packages, an installer,
    possibly a live-CD, some amount of metadata associated with the arrangement
    of those elements and also a lot of information on managing it.

A distro release is a given version of a distribution. So, for Ubuntu, there
are releases (or planned releases) like "warty", "hoary" and "bendy".

Distro releases are retrieved with the IDistroReleaseSet utility, much like
people are retrieved with the IPersonSet utility, or bug tasks are retrieved
with the IBugTaskSet utility.

To demonstrate how to use this utility, let's simulate interacting with the
system as an anonymous user:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login('launchpad.anonymous')

The IDistroReleaseSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroReleaseSet
    >>> distroreleaseset = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)

To retrieve a specific release of a distribution, use IDistroReleaseSet.get:

    >>> warty = distroreleaseset.get(1)
    >>> print warty.name
    warty
