    <h1>There are two ways to initialize a new series:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A continuation of a distribution with existing series. For example,
      after the previous series was released you might want to open a new
      development series by copying the previous one.
      </li>
      <li>A derived distribution series. This is where you have a new
      distribution and you want to copy the packages form a series in a
      different distribution.
      </li>
