    <h1>Verifying a download</h1>

    <p>There are two ways to check the files you've downloaded from a project, using Launchpad:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>using the MD5 sum that Launchpad generates</li>
      <li>optionally, using the digital signature generated if the uploader signed the file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The difference between the two is that the MD5 lets you check the file hasn't changed between leaving Launchpad and arriving on your machine, whereas the signature let's you check that the file hasn't changed since it was signed.</p>

    <h2>Using the MD5 sum</h2>

    <p>
      When a project maintainer uploads a file that they want to make available for download, Launchpad analyses the file using the MD5 security algorithm. This produces a short sequence of letters and numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use that sequence, called the MD5 sum, to check that the file has arrived on your machine in-tact.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the MD5 sum by following the <code>md5</code> link next to the file you've downloaded.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, enter the directory where you downloaded the file and type:</p>

    <p>
      <code>md5sum filename</code>
    </p>

    <p>Obviously you need to replace <em>filename</em> with the name of the file you downloaded.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You'll see an MD5 sum. Check that it's the same as the one you obtained in step 1. If the two sums are different, there has been a problem downloading the file and you should try again.</p>

    <h2>Verifying a signature</h2>

    <p>When a project maintainer uploads a file to Launchpad, they have the option of also electronically signing the file and uploading the resultant signature.</p>

    <p>You can tell which files have a signature by looking out for the <em>asc</em> link alongside the <em>md5</em> link. Verifying the files signature lets you check that the file is exactly as intended by whoever signed the file. </p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the signature file to the same directory where you've downloaded the project file you want to verify.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, visit the directory where you've saved the file and signature and enter the following:</p>
