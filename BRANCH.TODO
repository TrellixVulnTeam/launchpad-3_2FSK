# Put your TODOs for this branch here, then make sure it is empty before
# landing. There is a test to ensure it is empty in trunk. If there is
# stuff still here when you are ready to land, the items should probably
# be converted to bugs so they can be scheduled.

TODO:

* validation errors give misleading messages
* uncaught constraint error on duplicate of code import URL
* code.lp.dev/proj/series displays the overview page but it should
    direct away from the code vhost
