Let's take a tour of the Launchpad specification management system.

First, we should be able to see a list of latest specs on any product or
distribution in Launchpad. This should take the form of a portlet on the
product or distribution home page, showing latest specs.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Latest specifications:...
  ...Support E4X in EcmaScript...

If there are no specifications, then we should see an indication that no
specs have been registered for this product or distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/debian/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Latest specifications:...
  ...No specifications registered...


On both product and distribution we should be able to see a list of
specifications, at +specs.

First, let's check on product.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Now, on distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/debian/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
