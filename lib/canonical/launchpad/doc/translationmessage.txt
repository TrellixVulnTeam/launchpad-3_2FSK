= TranslationMessage =

Let's do some imports we will need to test this class.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
    ...     POTemplate, POTMsgSet, TranslationMessage)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     ILanguageSet, ITranslationMessage)

    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(1)
    >>> potmsgsets = potemplate.getPOTMsgSets()
    >>> potmsgset = potmsgsets[0]

This class links the translations submitted by a translator with the associated
POFile and POTMsgSet.  TranslationMessage and DummyTranslationMessage both
implement ITranslationMessage interface:

    >>> translationmessage = TranslationMessage.get(1)
    >>> verifyObject(ITranslationMessage, translationmessage)
    True

    >>> dummy_translationmessage = potmsgset.getCurrentDummyTranslationMessage(
    ...     getUtility(ILanguageSet)['sr'])
    >>> verifyObject(ITranslationMessage, dummy_translationmessage)
    True

== destroySelf ==

With this method, we allow to remove a submission, it comes from SQLObject,
but we test it here to be sure it appears in our public interface.

We will need extra permissions to use this method.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.harness import (
    ...     LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup)
    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup(dbuser='rosettaadmin').setUp()

Select an existing ITranslationMessage and try to remove it.

    >>> translationmessage = TranslationMessage.get(1)
    >>> translationmessage.destroySelf()

It should not exist now.

    >>> translationmessage = TranslationMessage.get(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SQLObjectNotFound:...

    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup().tearDown()

== plural_forms ==

This property returns a number of plural forms needed for a TranslationMessage
to be 'complete', i.e. contain all the necessary translations.

Serbian language has three plural forms:

    >>> serbian = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['sr']
    >>> serbian.pluralforms
    3

And Divehi has no plural forms defined in our sampledata:

    >>> divehi = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['dv']
    >>> print divehi.pluralforms
    None

We can look at a POTMsgSet with no plural forms:

    >>> potmsgset_no_plural = POTMsgSet.select("msgid_plural IS NULL")[0]
    >>> print potmsgset_no_plural.plural_text
    None

Any TranslationMessage for such a POTMsgSet returns a single plural form in
the translation, no matter the number of plural forms defined for the
language:

    >>> current_sr = potmsgset_no_plural.getCurrentDummyTranslationMessage(
    ...     serbian)
    >>> current_sr.plural_forms
    1
    >>> current_dv = potmsgset_no_plural.getCurrentDummyTranslationMessage(
    ...     divehi)
    >>> current_dv.plural_forms
    1

For any POTMsgSet using plural forms, we get a defined number of plural
forms per language (3 for Serbian), or a default of 2 when language doesn't
define it (like with Divehi).

    >>> potmsgset_plural = POTMsgSet.select("msgid_plural IS NOT NULL")[0]
    >>> # To improve stability of the test, we use the 'is not None' check,
    >>> # even if recommended against it in our tests style guide.
    >>> potmsgset_plural.plural_text is not None
    True
    >>> current_sr = potmsgset_plural.getCurrentDummyTranslationMessage(
    ...     serbian)
    >>> current_sr.plural_forms
    3
    >>> current_dv = potmsgset_plural.getCurrentDummyTranslationMessage(
    ...     divehi)
    >>> current_dv.plural_forms
    2
