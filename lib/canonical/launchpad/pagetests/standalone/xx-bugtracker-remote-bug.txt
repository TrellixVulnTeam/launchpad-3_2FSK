Remote Bug Information Pages
============================

Launchpad provides the ability for bugs to "watch" remote bugs.  You
can easily see which remote bugs a Launchpad bug watches by looking at
the "Remote Bug Watches" portlet on the bug's page.

To see what Launchpad bugs are watching a particular remote bug, we
use a URL of the form /malone/bugtrackers/$bugtrackername/$remotebug.

If there are multiple Launchpad bugs watching a particular remote bug,
then a list of the relevant Launchpad bugs:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone/bugtrackers/mozilla.org/42 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
  <title>Remote Bug #42 in The Mozilla.org Bug Tracker</title>
  ...
  <a href=".../malone/bugs/1">
  ...
  <a href=".../malone/bugs/2">
  ...


If there is only a single bug watching the remote bug, then we skip
the list page and redirect the user directly to that bug's page:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone/bugtrackers/mozilla.org/2000 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
  Location: .../malone/bugs/1
  <BLANKLINE>


If there are no bug watches for a particular remote bug, then a Not
Found page is generated:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone/bugtrackers/mozilla.org/999 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
