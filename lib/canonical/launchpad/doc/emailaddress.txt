= Email Addresses =

In Launchpad we use email addresses to uniquely identify a person. This is why
email addresses must be unique.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IEmailAddressSet, IPersonSet
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> foobar = personset.getByName('name16')
    >>> emailset = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet)
    >>> emailset.getByEmail('test@canonical.com').email
    u'test@canonical.com'

Trying to register an email address that already exists will raise an
exception.

    >>> emailset.new('test@canonical.com', foobar)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    EmailAddressAlreadyTaken: The email address 'test@canonical.com' is
    already registered.

The email address verification is case insensitive:

    >>> emailset.new('Test@Canonical.com', foobar)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    EmailAddressAlreadyTaken: The email address 'Test@Canonical.com' is
    already registered.

Registering a new email address works -- and preserves case -- though:

    >>> emailaddress = emailset.new('oink@Canonical.com', foobar)
    >>> emailaddress.email
    u'oink@Canonical.com'

Generating SHA1 hashes for RDF output is easy:

    >>> emailaddress.rdf_sha1
    '3738A7C5FB02B103FEF1F3CDAA9B086B6C382F6E'

There's a convenience method on IEmailAddressSet to pull preferred email
addresses for a set of people:

    >>> guadamen = personset.getByName('guadamen')
    >>> [emailaddress.email for emailaddress in
    ...  emailset.getPreferredEmailForPeople(guadamen.allmembers)]
    [u'colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com',
     u'foo.bar@canonical.com',
     u'support@ubuntu.com']


== Deleting email addresses ==

Email addresses may be deleted if they're not a person's preferred one
or the address of a team's mailing list.

    >>> login(foobar.preferredemail.email)
    >>> emailaddress = emailset.getByEmail('oink@canonical.com')
    >>> emailaddress.destroySelf()
    >>> print emailset.getByEmail('oink@canonical.com')
    None

Otherwise, UndeletableEmailAddress is raised.

    >>> foobar.preferredemail.destroySelf()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UndeletableEmailAddress: This is a person's preferred email...

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IMailingListSet, MailingListStatus)
    >>> mailing_list = getUtility(IMailingListSet).new(guadamen)
    >>> mailing_list.review(foobar, MailingListStatus.APPROVED)
    >>> mailing_list.startConstructing()
    >>> mailing_list.transitionToStatus(MailingListStatus.ACTIVE)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> email = emailset.getByEmail(guadamen.mailing_list.address)
    >>> email.destroySelf()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UndeletableEmailAddress: This is the email address of a team's mailing
    list...
