= Web Service API Declarations =

You can easily create a web service by tagging your content interfaces
with some decorators. From this tagging the web service API will be
created automatically.

== Exporting the data model ==

The LAZR Web Service data model consists of entries and collection (see
webservice.txt for all the details). Entries support the IEntry
interface and are basically a single resource exported. Think something
like a bug, a person, an article, etc. Collections are a set of
resources of the same types, think something like the set of bugs,
persons, teams, articles, etc.

Only entries are exported as data. You can mark that one of your content
interface is exported on the web service as an entry, by using the
export_entry declaration.

You can mark the fields that should be part of the entry data model by
using the export_field directive. It takes an optional 'as' parameter
that can be used to change the name under which the field will be
exported.

For example, this example declares that the IBook interface is
exported as an entry on the  web service. It exports the title, author,
and base_price field, but not the inventory_number field.

    >>> from zope.interface import Interface
    >>> from zope.schema import TextLine, Float
    >>> from canonical.lazr.rest.declarations import (
    ...     export_entry, export_field)
    >>> class IBook(Interface):
    ...     """A simple book data model."""
    ...     export_entry()
    ...
    ...     title = TextLine(title=u'The book title')
    ...     export_field(title)
    ...
    ...     author = TextLine(title=u"The book's author.")
    ...     export_field(author)
    ...
    ...     base_price = Float(title=u"The regular price of the book.")
    ...     export_field(base_price, as='price')
    ...
    ...     inventory_number = TextLine(title=u'The inventory part number.')

These declarations adds tagged value to the original interface elements.
The tags are in the lazr.webservice namespace and are dictionaries of
elements.

    >>> def print_dict_tag(element, name):
    ...     tag = element.queryTaggedValue(name)
    ...     if tag is None:
    ...         print "tag '%s' is not present" % name
    ...     else:
    ...         print "\n".join(
    ...             "%s: %r" %(key, value)
    ...             for key, value in sorted(tag.items()))
    >>> print_dict_tag(IBook, 'lazr.webservice.exported')
    type: 'entry'
    >>> print_dict_tag(IBook['title'], 'lazr.webservice.exported')
    as: 'title'
    type: 'field'
    >>> print_dict_tag(IBook['author'], 'lazr.webservice.exported')
    as: 'author'
    type: 'field'
    >>> print_dict_tag(IBook['base_price'], 'lazr.webservice.exported')
    as: 'price'
    type: 'field'
    >>> print_dict_tag(IBook['inventory_number'], 'lazr.webservice.exported')
    tag 'lazr.webservice.exported' is not present

Only IField can be exported as entry fields.

    >>> from zope.interface import Attribute
    >>> class NotAField1(Interface):
    ...     an_attribute = Attribute('A standard attribute')
    ...     export_field(an_attribute)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: export_field() can only be used on IFields.

In the same vein, export_entry() can only be used on Interface.

    >>> class NotAnInterface(object):
    ...     export_entry()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: export_entry() can only be used on an interface.

And from within a class declaration.
    >>> export_entry()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: export_entry() can only be used from within an interface
    definition.
