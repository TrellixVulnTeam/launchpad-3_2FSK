= Adding tickets in languages other than English =

It is possible to create support requests in a language other than
English. The 'Request Support' page has a pop-up where the user
can select the language of the request. By default, the support request
language is 'English'.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+tickets')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Request Support').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Language').value
    ['en']

The user may choose from any of his preferred languages and there is a
link to enable to change his preferred languages:

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Change your preferred languages').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Sample Person's preferred languages
    >>> user_browser.url
    '.../~name12/+editlanguages'

Although it's possible to add tickets in any of the user's preferred
languages, we need to do some checks to warn the user in case he's using
a language that is not spoken/understood by any of the context's support
contacts.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic salgado@ubuntu.com:zeca')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+addticket')

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value = ['pt_BR']
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     'Abrir uma pagina que requer java quebra o firefox')
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

At this point we'll present any similar tickets (in any language) /and/
a warning message explaining that the chosen language is not understood
by any member of the support community.

    >>> similar_tickets = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'similar-tickets')
    >>> for row in similar_tickets.findAll('tr', 'noted'):
    ...     row.first('a').renderContents()
    'Installation of Java Runtime Environment for Mozilla'
    'Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp (doble-n\xc3\xbacleo)'
    'mailto: problem in webpage'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    <strong>Portuguese (Brazil) (pt_BR)</strong> doesn't seem to be
    a language spoken by any support contacts in this community. If you
    go ahead and make a support request in that language, no support
    contacts will be able to read it. Currently, the languages spoken
    by at least one support contact are: English.

The user can still use the 'Change preferred language' link to change
the list of available languages:

    >>> browser.getLink('Change your preferred languages').url
    '.../+editmylanguages'

Since we've already shown the warning, we won't try to block the user
from making a request in the language of his choice.

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value
    ['pt_BR']
    >>> browser.getControl('Description').value = (
    ...     u'Eu uso Ubuntu em um AMD64 e instalei o plugin java blackdown. '
    ...     u'O plugin \xe9 exibido em about:plugins e quando eu abro a '
    ...     u'pagina http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml, ela '
    ...     u'carrega corretamente e mostra a minha versao do java. No '
    ...     u'entanto, mover o mouse na pagina faz com que o firefox quebre.'
    ...     ).encode('utf-8')
    >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()
    >>> browser.url
    '.../ubuntu/+ticket/...'
    >>> browser.title
    'Ubuntu support request #...Abrir uma pagina que requer...'

    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.find('b', text='Language:').next.strip()
    Portuguese (Brazil)

It's also possible that the user choses English in the first page but
then changes his mind on the second page.

    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic daf@canonical.com:daf')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+addticket')

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value = ['en']
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = 'some random words'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

In this case he won't be warned, because we assume all members of the
support community can understand English.

    >>> len(find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'))
    0

If now he changes his mind and decides to enter the request details in
Welsh, we'll have to warn him.

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value = ['cy']
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = 'Gofyn cymorth'
    >>> browser.getControl('Description').value = (
    ...     'Ghai damweiniol gair.')
    >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+addticket'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    <strong>Welsh (cy)</strong> doesn't seem to be
    a language spoken by any support contacts in this community. If you
    go ahead and make a support request in that language, no support
    contacts will be able to read it. Currently, the languages spoken
    by at least one support contact are: English.

If he changes the language to another unsupported language, we will
display the warning again.

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value = ['ja']
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     u'\u52a9\u3051\u306e\u8981\u6c42'.encode('utf-8'))
    >>> browser.getControl('Description').value = (
    ...     u'\u3042\u308b\u4efb\u610f\u5358\u8a9e\u3002'.encode('utf-8'))
    >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    <strong>Japanese (ja)</strong> doesn't seem to be
    a language spoken by any support contacts in this community. If you
    go ahead and make a support request in that language, no support
    contacts will be able to read it. Currently, the languages spoken
    by at least one support contact are: English.

If even after the warning he decides to go ahead, we have to accept the
new support request.

    >>> browser.getControl('Add').click()
    >>> browser.url
    '.../ubuntu/+ticket/...'
    >>> browser.title.decode('utf-8')
    u'Ubuntu support request #...\u52a9\u3051\u306e\u8981\u6c42...'
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.find('b', text='Language:').next.strip()
    Japanese
