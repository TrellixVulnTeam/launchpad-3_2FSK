    Each email address registered in a BugNotificationRecipients is
    associated to a string and a header that explain why the address is
    being emailed. For instance, if the email address is that of a
    distribution bug supervisor for a bug, the string and header will make
    that fact clear.

    The string is meant to be rendered in the email footer. The header
    is meant to be used in an X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale header.

    The first rationale registered for an email address is the one
    which will be used, regardless of other rationales being added
    for it later. This gives us a predictable policy of preserving
    the first reason added to the registry; the callsite should
    ensure that the manipulation of the BugNotificationRecipients
    instance is done in preferential order.

    Instances of this class are meant to be returned by
    IBug.getBugNotificationRecipients().
