  The shipit admins can do any changes they want to a request.

  First let's approve request number 12.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/requests/12 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFyaWxpemVAaGJkLmNvbTp0ZXN0
  ... 
  ... field.ubuntu_quantityx86approved=9&field.ubuntu_quantityamd64approved=3&field.ubuntu_quantityppcapproved=9&field.kubuntu_quantityx86approved=0&field.kubuntu_quantityamd64approved=0&field.edubuntu_quantityx86approved=0&field.highpriority.used=&APPROVE=Approve""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://shipit.async.com.br//requests/13?previous=12&approved=1
  <BLANKLINE>


  That redirected us to the next request pending approval.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++//requests/13?previous=12&approved=1 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFyaWxpemVAaGJkLmNvbTp0ZXN0
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The request #12...
  ...was approved...
  ...
  ...This request is...
  ...still waiting for approval...
  ...


  But this request's address was wrong, and Marilize noticed that, so she'll
  correct it by going to the /adminrequest page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/adminrequest?order=13 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFyaWxpemVAaGJkLmNvbTp0ZXN0
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Change a Request...
  ...
  ...<input class="textType" id="field.addressline1"...
  ...


  Now she submits her changes.

  >>> print http(r"""

  But then she realizes this person requested too many CDs without a good
  reason, so she denies the request, and get redirected to this same request,
  because there are no other pending requests.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++//requests/13 HTTP/1.1

  Marilize can also create new requests on behalf of other people. She can
  specify any number of CDs from all different flavours/architectures and
  these requests are automatically approved.
