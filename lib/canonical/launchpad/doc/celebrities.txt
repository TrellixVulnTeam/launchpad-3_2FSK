Launchpad Celebrities
=====================

See https://wiki.launchpad.canonical.com/LaunchpadCelebrities

There are a number of special objects, some of which exist in the database,
which we want to give easy access to in the code.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> login('launchpad.anonymous')

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)

  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> buttsource = personset.getByName('buttsource')
  >>> celebs.buttsource.__class__ == buttsource.__class__
  True
  >>> celebs.buttsource.id == buttsource.id
  True

  TODO: add interface verification test.
        ask debonzi to add these in general.
