===========================
 Rosetta command line tool
===========================

We want a Rosetta command line tool, to interact with testing, importd
and other tools we will be using in the server.

Local tool
===========

The tool will run on the same machine where Rosetta (Launchpad) is
installed, so no XML-RPC or httplib funky stuff; just import
lib.canonical.rosetta and rock on.

We will probably have to have a way of pointing it to where the source
tree is so that it can mess with the python path and parse the zcml
necessary to connect to the database.

Command line
=============

The sanest way to tell it what to do is probably a command line scheme
that uses subcommands, kind of similar to tla, but with two levels;
the first argument would be a class, the second one a "command".

Use cases
==========

Import PO template
-------------------

command line::

 % rosetta pofile parse xxx.po --potemplate ptid

Import PO file
---------------

command line::

 % rosetta potemplate parse xxx.pot --new --name="name" --title=""
