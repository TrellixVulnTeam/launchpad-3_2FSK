Bazaar Documentation
====================

This directory contains high level documentation describing the interactions of
the various non-web Launchpad subsystems that implement The Bazaar.

You can export the documentation to HTML and Postscript using, respectively,
``make html`` (the default target) and ``make ps``.

Modifying
=========

Please read this section before modifying the documentation.

The documentation is written using GNU TeXmacs (``apt-get install texmacs``)
and is saved as ``bzr-launchpad.tmml``. TeXmacs has a crashing bug which is
exercised by ``unclutter`` (a little utility that hides the mouse cursor), so
you must kill ``unclutter`` to use TeXmacs. The first minutes of use tend to be
a bit painful when TeXmacs compiles a bunch fonts, please be patient, and start
``texmacs`` from a terminal so you get some idea of what is going on.

All figures were created using ``dia`` (``apt-get install dia-gnome``) and are
stored in the ``dia`` and ``large-dia`` directories. The ``large-dia``
directory contains images which would be exported by default to a width greater
than 600 pixels.

If you modify a diagram from the ``large-dia`` directory, you should export it
manually from ``dia`` and set the width to be at most 600 pixels. Then run
``make large-dia/sizes`` to record the new size of the exported PNG file. This
is necessary because the ``dia`` command line does not support image export
with aspect-ratio preserving scaling.
