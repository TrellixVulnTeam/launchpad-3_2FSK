  Change the owner of the admins team.

  Logged in as no-priv@canonical.com we can't do that, because he's not the
  owner of the team nor a member of the admins team itself (remember that
  members of the admins team can do almost everything).


  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/admins/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bm8tcHJpdkBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  ...


  Now we're logged in as mark@hbd.com and he's a member of launchpad admins,
  so he can do everything.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/admins/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Change the teamowner of...
  ...
  ...Current teamowner:...
  ...
  ...Mark Shuttleworth...
  ...


  Here he tries to make the admins team owner of itself, but this is not
  allowed.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /people/admins/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... 
  ... field.owner=admins&existing=existing&CHANGE_OWNER=Change+Owner""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The person/team named 'admins' is not a valid owner...
  ...


  Now he reassigns the team to name16.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /people/admins/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... 
  ... field.owner=name16&existing=existing&CHANGE_OWNER=Change+Owner""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: .
  ...


  And here we see name16 (Foo Bar) as the new owner.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/admins/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Launchpad Administrators...
  ...
  ...Owner:...
  ...
  ...Foo Bar...
  ...
