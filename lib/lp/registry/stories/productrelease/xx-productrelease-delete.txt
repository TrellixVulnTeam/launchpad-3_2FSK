= Deleting product releases =

The main page of a product series includes a list of releases of that series.
The 0.9.2 milestone has a release.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk')
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox trunk series
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'series-trunk'))
    Version "Codename"         Expected   Released     Summary
    Mozilla Firefox 0.9.2 ...  None       2004-10-15   ...


A User with launchpad.Edit rights for a release can see the delete link and
access the delete page. A user without the necessary rights won't see the
link and cannot access the +delete page.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('0.9.2').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox 0.9.2 "One (secure) Tree Hill"
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='/firefox/trunk/0.9.2/+delete')
