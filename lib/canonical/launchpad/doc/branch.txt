Arch Branches
=============

The Branch table holds information about an Arch Branch, it's an
abstract table that holds a reference to an Arch Namespace which
itself holds a reference to an Arch Archive.

We need to represent this as an Arch "package" string suitable for
the command-line tool.  So we provide a function to do that.

We can get a Branch object in the normal way.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.archbranch import Branch
    >>> branch = Branch.get(13)

Calling getPackageName() should yield the full string:

    >>> print branch.getPackageName()
    mozilla@arch.ubuntu.com/mozilla--release--0.8

It should work for a branch without a complete namespace too:

    >>> branch = Branch.get(1)
    >>> print branch.getPackageName()
    mozilla@arch.ubuntu.com/mozilla
