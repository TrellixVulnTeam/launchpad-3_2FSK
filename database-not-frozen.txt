database-frozen.txt
-------------------

If a file called 'database-frozen.txt' exists in the root of the
Launchpad tree, then merges containing database changes will be rejected
by PQM. Check the top level Makefile for the current rules on what this
means.

Status
------
Database is not frozen. Database freeze is expected to be reenabled in a
few days.
