Working with Launchpad Answers over the API
===========================================

Users can work with question targets and questions over the api to
search and update questions. This demonstration will use a project, it's
contact, and asker, and three questions.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.app.enums import ServiceUsage
    >>> from lp.services.worlddata.interfaces.language import ILanguageSet
    >>> lang_set = getUtility(ILanguageSet)

    >>> contact = factory.makePerson(name='contact')
    >>> project = factory.makeProduct(name='my-project', owner=contact)
    >>> login_person(contact)
    >>> contact.addLanguage(lang_set['en'])
    >>> project.answers_usage = ServiceUsage.LAUNCHPAD
    >>> success = project.addAnswerContact(contact)
    >>> asker = factory.makePerson(name='asker')
    >>> login_person(asker)
    >>> question_1 = factory.makeQuestion(
    ...     target=project, title="Q 1", owner=asker)
    >>> question_2 = factory.makeQuestion(
    ...     target=project, title="Q 2", owner=asker)
    >>> question_3 = factory.makeQuestion(
    ...     target=project, title="Q 3", owner=asker)
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

Answers can be used by anonymous connection to see data, and autheticated
connections can change data.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import (
    ...     LaunchpadWebServiceCaller)
    >>> anon_webservice = LaunchpadWebServiceCaller('launchpad-library', '')
    >>> webservice = LaunchpadWebServiceCaller(
    ...     'launchpad-library', 'salgado-change-anything')
