For distros having no series registered, there's a report that lists all
distro bugs linked to CVEs.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/gentoo/+cve')
    >>> main = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(main.h1)
    CVEs related to bugs in Gentoo

The report lists the open and closed bugs.

    >>> [extract_text(h2) for h2 in main.findAll('h2')]
    [u'Open bugs',
     u'Resolved bugs']

For distros having series, no report isn't shown for the complete
distro, since it's probably too big.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+cve')
    >>> main = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> [extract_text(h2) for h2 in main.findAll('h2')]
    []

Instead, the links for the specific series reports are shown.

    >>> print extract_text(main.h1)
    CVE reports in releases of Ubuntu

    >>> [extract_text(li) for li in main.findAll('li')]
    [u'Breezy Badger Autotest',
     u'Grumpy',
     u'Hoary',
     u'Warty']

    >>> browser.getLink('Breezy Badger Autotest').click()
    >>> main = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(main.h1)
    CVEs related to bugs in Ubuntu Breezy-autotest
