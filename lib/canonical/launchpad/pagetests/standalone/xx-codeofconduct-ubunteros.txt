= Codes of Conduct and Ubunteros =

Administrators can check the list of people that have signed the Code of
Conduct. Foo Bar should appear on the list even though he signed the 1.0
version, which is non-current but still valid.

    # A useful helper
    >>> def is_ubuntero(page):
    ...     return find_tag_by_id(page, 'ubuntero').renderContents()

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people/+ubunterolist')
    >>> admin_browser.title
    'Ubunteros registered in Launchpad'
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Foo Bar (name16)').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~name16'
    >>> print is_ubuntero(admin_browser.contents)
    Yes

    >>> admin_browser.getLink(url='+codesofconduct').click()
    >>> '2005-09-27' in admin_browser.contents
    True
    >>> '1024D/12345678' in admin_browser.contents
    True

Administrators can't sign the Code of Conduct for other users.  If the
administrator views the page of someone who isn't an Ubuntero, then the
application link and their Ubuntero status is missing.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(admin_browser.contents, 'ubuntero')
    None
    >>> admin_browser.getLink(url='codeofconduct')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

No-priv hasn't signed up to be an Ubuntero yet.  His homepage will have
a link to the Ubuntero Code of Conduct forms.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv')
    >>> print is_ubuntero(browser.contents)
    No

    >>> browser.getLink(url='codeofconduct')
    <Link
      text='Apply to become an Ubuntero[IMG]'
      url='http://launchpad.dev/codeofconduct'>
