Launchpad Build UI notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are various parts to the buildd network which will have status
information which can be presented to various of the users.

The following classes of users exist...

 o Boggy standard user
 o Distribution build manager (member of some team or something)
 o Package maintainer (independant)
 o Package maintainer (in a distro context)
 o Distribution security team member (can see hidden builds)
 o Canonical buildd maintainer

The buildd maintainer view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The buildd maintainer wants to know if there are any builds failing
due to buildd-related issues. I.E. if any builds are returning
CHROOTFAIL or BUILDERFAIL

The buildd maintainer also wants to see the build queues and the
states of each buildd in the farm.

The boggy-standard user view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A plain and simple user (E.g. unauthenticated web access) can only see
build logs of unrestricted packages. They can see if a package is
queued to be built but no information on when it may be built.

The independant package maintainer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An independant package maintainer will basically see the above and
also an ETA for each architecture's package build for their packages.

For failed builds they can obviously see build logs.

The package maintainer within a distro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A distro package maintainer gets to see the ETA of their package in
each of the arch queues; also what packages are ahead of it.

Distribution security team member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gets to see all the above; but also for restricted distroseries

Distribution build manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gets to see an overview of all the queues and can give back packages
which managed to enter a manual dep-wait state or similar.


Pages we're likely to need
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 o A view for the buildd maintainer. How to designate this I am
   unsure; perhaps this ought to be a program to run to generate the
   info rather than a web page. [[TODO: Ask lamont about this]]
 o Build log viewer
 o Build queue viewer, optionally limited to a specific
   build/sourcepackagerelease/sourcepackage/distroseries/arch
 o A way to give-back packages to re-try the build
