= Finding the nearest adapter =

The nearest_adapter() and nearest_context_with_adapter() will search the
navigation hierarchy for a content-type that supplies the requested
adaptation.


== A sample hierarchy ==

First, we'll construct an example object hierarchy.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import canonical_url, urlsplit
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import ICanonicalUrlData
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from zope.interface import implements, directlyProvides, Interface
    >>> from zope.security.management import endInteraction, newInteraction

    >>> from zope.interface import Interface

    >>> class ICookbook(Interface):
    ...     """An object with facets and menus."""

    >>> class IRecipe(Interface):
    ...     """An object with facets and menus."""

    >>> class BaseContent:
    ...     implements(ICanonicalUrlData)
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self, name, parent):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.path = name
    ...         self.inside = parent
    ...         self.rootsite = None

    >>> class Root(BaseContent):
    ...     """The root of 'cookery', a vhost and facet."""

    >>> class Cookbook(BaseContent):
    ...     implements(ICookbook)

    >>> class Recipe(BaseContent):
    ...     implements(IRecipe)


    # nearest_adapter() uses canonical_url(), which in turn requires a
    # running interaction.  We'll need to set up a test request to make it
    # work.
    >>> def make_fake_request(url, traversed_objects=None):
    ...     """Return a fake request object for menu testing."""
    ...     url_parts = urlsplit(url)
    ...     server_url = '://'.join(url_parts[0:2])
    ...     path_info = url_parts[2]
    ...     request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...         SERVER_URL=server_url,
    ...         PATH_INFO=path_info)
    ...     # After making the request, setup a new interaction.
    ...     endInteraction()
    ...     newInteraction(request)
    ...     return request

Here is the structure of our hierarchy:

    >>> root = BaseContent('', None)
    >>> cookbook = Cookbook('joy-of-cooking', root)
    >>> recipe = Recipe('fried-spam', cookbook)

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam')

    >>> canonical_url(cookbook)
    u'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking'
    >>> canonical_url(recipe)
    u'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam'


== Using nearest_adapter ==

We'll try adapting our objects to a made-up interface, IPrintable.

    >>> class IPrintable(Interface):
    ...     """Something that is tasty."""

    >>> class BookPrinter:
    ...     implements(IPrintable)
    ...     def __init__(self, context):
    ...         self.context = context

Right now, none of our example objects can be turned into places.

    >>> from canonical.lazr.canonicalurl import (nearest_adapter,
    ...     nearest_context_with_adapter)

    >>> print nearest_adapter(root, IPrintable)
    None
    >>> print nearest_adapter(cookbook, IPrintable)
    None
    >>> print nearest_adapter(recipe, IPrintable)
    None

The same holds true for nearest_context_with_adapter():

    >>> nearest_context_with_adapter(root, IPrintable)
    (None, None)

We'll make the "cookbook" object adaptable to IPrintable.

    >>> from zope.component import provideAdapter
    >>> provideAdapter(BookPrinter, [ICookbook], IPrintable)

    >>> IPrintable(cookbook)
    <...BookPrinter instance ...>

The nearest_adapter() function will look up the hierarchy for an object
that has the requested adaptation.

"recipe" does not provide IPrintable, but "cookbook" does, so cookbook's
adapter will be returned.

    >>> print nearest_adapter(recipe, IPrintable)
    <...BookPrinter instance ...>

Calling nearest_adapter() on "cookbook" itself will return the
BookPrinter:

    >>> print nearest_adapter(cookbook, IPrintable)
    <...BookPrinter instance ...>

Calling nearest_adapter() on the hierarchy root returns nothing:
the root does not have the requested adaptation, and there are no higher
objects to search.

    >>> print nearest_adapter(root, IPrintable)
    None
