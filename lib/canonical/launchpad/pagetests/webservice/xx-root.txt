The service root (/) is a resource that responds to GET by describing
the web service. Right now, it just sends a simple string description.
you get a string.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Though web services in general support all HTTP methods, this
particular resource supports only GET. Eventually it will also support
HEAD and OPTIONS.

  >>> for method in ['HEAD', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']:
  ...     print http(r"""
  ... %s / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """ % method)
