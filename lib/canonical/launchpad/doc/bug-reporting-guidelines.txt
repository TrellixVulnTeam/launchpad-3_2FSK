= Bug Reporting Guidelines =

Guidelines can be set at the Distribution, Project or Product level to
help users file good bug reports, direct them to FAQs, and so forth.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
    ...     DistributionSet, ProjectSet, ProductSet)

    >>> distribution = DistributionSet().getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> project = ProjectSet().getByName('mozilla')
    >>> product = ProductSet().getByName('firefox')

    >>> for context in [distribution, project, product]:
    ...     context.bug_reporting_guidelines = (
    ...         "Welcome to %s!" % context.displayname)

In fact, all IBugTargets have guidelines available, but the others
delegate to the distribution or product level.

DistroSeries, SourcePackages and DistributionSourcePackages defer to
the Distribution:

    >>> distro_series = distribution.getSeries('warty')
    >>> print distro_series.bug_reporting_guidelines
    Welcome to Ubuntu!

    >>> source_package = distro_series.getSourcePackage('alsa-utils')
    >>> print source_package.bug_reporting_guidelines
    Welcome to Ubuntu!

    >>> distribution_source_package = (
    ...     distribution.getSourcePackage('alsa-utils'))
    >>> print distribution_source_package.bug_reporting_guidelines
    Welcome to Ubuntu!

ProductSeries defer to the Product:

    >>> product_series = product.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> print product_series.bug_reporting_guidelines
    Welcome to Mozilla Firefox!

One day these objects that defer bug_reporting_guidelines may have
their own guidelines. In the meantime the deferral is done with a
read-only property:

    >>> distro_series.bug_reporting_guidelines = 'Foobar'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: can't set attribute

    >>> source_package.bug_reporting_guidelines = 'Foobar'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: can't set attribute

    >>> distribution_source_package.bug_reporting_guidelines = 'Foobar'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: can't set attribute

    >>> product_series.bug_reporting_guidelines = 'Foobar'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: can't set attribute
