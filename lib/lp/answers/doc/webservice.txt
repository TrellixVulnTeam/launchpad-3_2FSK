Working with Launchpad Answers over the API
===========================================

Users can work with question targets and questions over the api to
search and update questions.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import (
    ...     LaunchpadWebServiceCaller)
    >>> anon_webservice = LaunchpadWebServiceCaller('launchpad-library', '')
    >>> webservice = LaunchpadWebServiceCaller(
    ...     'launchpad-library', 'salgado-change-anything')
