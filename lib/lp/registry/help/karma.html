    <h1>What is karma?</h1>

    <p>
      Karma is one way of showing how large a contribution someone has made
      in Launchpad.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Almost everything you do in Launchpad helps you to build karma. For 
      example: registering bugs, translating strings and answering support 
      requests. Your karma is a reflection of the type of work you've done 
      and when you did it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Karma is only attributed for work done in Launchpad and does not 
      apply to items imported from other sources.
