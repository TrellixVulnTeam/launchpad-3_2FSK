Commercial PPAs
===============

XXX - update this document.

Commercial PPAs are to all intents and purposes identical to private PPAs.
They contain a 'commercial' flag which indicates that the PPA is actively
selling software and should be more discoverable.

We have a private PPA for demonstration purposes:

    >>> ppa_name = 'pppa'
    >>> ppa = factory.makeArchive(private=True, name=ppa_name)
    >>> owner_name = ppa.owner.name


Security
--------

Anyone is allowed to retrieve the list of commercial PPAs.  Normal security
restrictions apply to individual PPA access though.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> owner = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName(owner_name)
    >>> ppa = owner.getPPAByName('pppa')

'name is a public attribute:

    >>> print ppa.name
    pppa

'description' is not, however.

    >>> ppa.description
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...
