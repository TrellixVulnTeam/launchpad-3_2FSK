There are two pages we want to be able to see. The first shows the packages
by distribution:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+distributions HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
    <h1>Packages by distribution</h1>
  ...
      <h2>Ubuntu Linux</h2>
  ...

And the second shows the packages by product series:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+packages HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
    <h1>Distribution packages</h1>
  ...
      <h2>Release series: trunk</h2>
  ...
