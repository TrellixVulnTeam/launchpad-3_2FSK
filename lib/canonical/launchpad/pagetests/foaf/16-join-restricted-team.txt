  'name16' tries to join 'myemail' again, but now it's a RESTRICTED team, and
  nobody can ask to join.


  First we completely remove 'name16' from the team.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamMembership
  >>> foobar = Person.byName('name16')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> foobar.leave(team)
  True
  >>> tm = TeamMembership.selectBy(personID=foobar.id, teamID=team.id)[0]
  >>> tm.destroySelf()


  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/myemail/+join HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
  >>> foobar = Person.byName('salgado')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> foobar.hasMembershipEntryFor(team)
  False
