The LaunchBag is a collection of all the 'stuff' we have traversed. It
contains the request's 'context' or environment, which can be used to
filter or otherwise specialize views or behavior.

First, we'll set up various imports and stub objects.

>>> from zope.component import getUtility
>>> from zope.session.interfaces import ISession
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag, IOpenLaunchBag
>>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import BasicAuthLoggedInEvent
>>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import LoggedOutEvent
>>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import \
...     CookieAuthPrincipalIdentifiedEvent

>>> person = object()

>>> class Principal(object):
...     id = 23
...     def __conform__(self, protocol):
...         if protocol is IPerson:
...             return person

>>> principal = Principal()
>>> class Participation(object):
...     principal = principal
...     interaction = None

>>> class Response(object):
...     def getCookie(self, name):
...         return None

>>> class Request(object):
...     principal = principal
...     response = Response()
...     cookies = {}
...     def setPrincipal(self, principal):
...         pass

>>> request = Request()

There have been no logins, so launchbag.login will be None.

>>> launchbag = getUtility(ILaunchBag)
>>> print launchbag.login
None

Let's send a basic auth login event.

>>> login = "foo.bar@canonical.com"
>>> event = BasicAuthLoggedInEvent(request, login, principal)
>>> from zope.event import notify
>>> notify(event)

Now, launchbag.login will be 'foo.bar@canonical.com'.

>>> print launchbag.login
foo.bar@canonical.com

Login should be set back to None on a logout.

>>> event = LoggedOutEvent(request)
>>> notify(event)
>>> print launchbag.login
None

Let's do a cookie auth principal identification.  In this case, the login
will be cookie@example.com.

>>> event = CookieAuthPrincipalIdentifiedEvent(
...     principal, request, 'cookie@example.com')
>>> notify(event)
>>> print launchbag.login
cookie@example.com
