= PO Import test with a .po file that has a syntax error =

When we import a .po file with a syntax error, we should notify
the user about that error so they have a chance to fix it.

In this test, we are going to check that we detect and notify the error.

Here are some imports we need to get this test running.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationImportQueue
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplateSubset
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
    >>> translation_import_queue = getUtility(ITranslationImportQueue)

We need this for the Librarian to work properly.

    >>> import transaction

And also, the DBSchema to change the imports status

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import RosettaImportStatus

Login as an admin to be able to do changes to the import queue.

    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')

Here's the person who'll be doing the import.

    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> person = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')

Now, is time to create the new potemplate

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ProductRelease
    >>> release = ProductRelease.get(3)
    >>> release.productseries.product.name
    u'firefox'
    >>> series = release.productseries
    >>> subset = POTemplateSubset(productseries=series)
    >>> potemplate = subset.new(
    ...     name='firefox',
    ...     translation_domain='firefox',
    ...     path='po/firefox.pot',
    ...     owner=person)

We create the POFile object where we are going to attach the .po file.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('cy')

Let's import a .po file that misses the '"' char after msgstr.
That's a syntax error.

    >>> pofile_contents = r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-03 20:41+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=n==1) "
    ...     "? 0 : n==2 ? 1 : (n != 8 || n != 11) ? 2 : 3;\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr blah"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    >>> published = False
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, published, person,
    ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()

We must approve the entry to be able to import it.

    >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED

We do the import.

    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)

The status is now FAILED:

    >>> entry.status == RosettaImportStatus.FAILED
    True

And the code composed an email with the notification of the error.

    >>> subject
    u'Import problem - Welsh (cy) - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
    >>> print message
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
