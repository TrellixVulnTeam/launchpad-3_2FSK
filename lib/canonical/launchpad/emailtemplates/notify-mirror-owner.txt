Hello

We just finished probing the mirror for distribution %(distro)s,
named %(mirror_name)s, that you registered on Launchpad, but we couldn't
find any content mirrored in the location you specified. For this reason,
we marked your mirror as disabled. It would be great if you could check
the mirror details, to make sure that everything is correct.

If all details are correct and the mirror is reachable, it could be
a problem in our side, and in that case you can file a bug on
https://launchpad.net/products/launchpad/+bugs

Thanks,

The Launchpad Team
