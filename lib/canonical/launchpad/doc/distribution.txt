Distributions
=============

From the DerivationOverview spec[1]:

    A distribution of GNU/Linux comprises a set of packages, an installer,
    possibly a live-CD, some amount of metadata associated with the arrangement
    of those elements and also a lot of information on managing it.

In Launchpad, one distribution is mapped to one row in the Distribution table.
To retrieve a distribution, use the IDistributionSet utility. If you've already
used IPersonSet to retrieve a Person, or IBugTaskSet to retrieve a task, this
syntax should look familiar.

Let's simulate interacting with the system as an anonymous user:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login('launchpad.anonymous')

The IDistributionSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> distroset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)

To retrieve a specific distribution, use IDistributionSet.get:

    >>> ubuntu = distroset.get(1)
    >>> print ubuntu.name
    ubuntu
