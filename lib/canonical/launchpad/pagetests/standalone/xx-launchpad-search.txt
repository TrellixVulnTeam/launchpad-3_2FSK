Launchpad provides a way for people to search across products, projects and
distributions. This is done at the /+search page.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+search')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='q').value = 'ubuntu'
    >>> browser.getControl('Search').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/+search?q=ubuntu&search=Search'

We'll only show up to config.launchpad.default_batch_size results; if there
are more results than that, we'll show an informational message and ask the
user to refine his search.

    >>> tags = find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, "informational message")
    >>> for tag in tags:
    ...   print tag.renderContents()
    More than 5 projects
    were found, so we're displaying only the ones that are most relevant
    to your search terms.
    If the project you are looking for is not on the list below, please
    do another search with more search terms.
    
    >>> print browser.contents
    <...
    ...<a href="/ubuntu">
    ...Ubuntu Linux...
    ...(distribution)...
    ...<a href="/ubuntu-product">
