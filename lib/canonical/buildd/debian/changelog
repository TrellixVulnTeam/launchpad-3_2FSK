  * sbuild: Don't allow versioned build-deps to be satisfied by provided
    packages, but force them to go through the "upgrade/downgrade" tests.
  * sbuild: Do --info and --contents on _all.deb packages as well, if
    we're building arch:all packages.

  * If we're fed an archive_purpose argument from the builddmaster,
    we pass --purpose=$archive_purpose to sbuild, and if we get suite
    from the builddmaster, we pass --dist=$suite to sbuild.
  * Mangle sbuild to write out Suite: and Purpose: stanzas to our
    CurrentlyBuilding file, according to command-line input.
  * Now that we're no longer always feeding -dautobuild to sbuild,
    fix up sbuild to always look for the chroot at chroot-autobuild
    instead of the Debian Way of using chroot-$suite.
  * If the config file contains an ntphost stanza, use that with
    ntpdate to sync the system's clock before we unpack the chroot.
  * Mangle update-config to add an ntphost stanza to the default
    config, and to 's/-dautobuild //' from the sbuild arguments.

  * unpack-chroot: set $PATH rather than hardcoding paths to binaries
    since bzip2 moved from /usr/bin to /bin in edgy and didn't bother with
    compatability symlinks.

launchpad-buildd (37) dapper; urgency=high

  * update-debian-chroot: Adam's LPIA support (i.e. overriding
    architecture for chapt-get).
  * debian/launchpad-buildd.cron.daily: fix run-on-line.
  * debian/postinst: only create ~buildd/.sbuildrc if it doesn't exist.
    This avoids the problem of upgrades of the launchpad-buildd package
    resetting the architecture to i386 on lpia builders.

  * changing override-sources to replace current sources.list with
    the content sent by buildmaster instead of prepend. It will allow
    us to cope more easily with SoyuzArchive implementation (PARTNER,

  * Mangle sbuild further to allow us to publish Martin's debug debs (ddeb)
    to public_html/ddebs/ until such a time as soyuz can do this natively.
  * Fix the auto-dep-wait regexes to allow for versions with ~ in them.
  * Make cron.daily clean out translations and ddebs more than 1 week old.

launchpad-buildd (32) unstable; urgency=low

  * We need to create /var/run/launchpad-buildd in our init script in the
    case (such as in current dapper) where /var/run is on a tmpfs.
  * Our init script shouldn't exit non-zero on "stop" if already stopped.
  * Remove exc_info argument from our call to self.log in slave.py, which
    clearly doesn't support that argument, so stop producing tracebacks.
  * Reset self.builddependencies in our clean routine, so the variable
    doesn't get leaked to the next build, causing me SERIOUS confusion.
  * Tidy up translation handling a bit more to deal with old chroots (where
    pkgstriptranslations won't dpkg-distaddfile for us), and to chmod the
    translation dirs after the build, so apache can actually get at them.
  * Add --no_save to our command line to avoid useless -shutdown.tap files.
  * Make sure umount-chroot doesn't fail, even if there's nothing to umount.
  * Append to the cron.daily cleaning to also occasionally clean up the apt
    cache and /home/buildd/filecache-default, so we don't run out of disk.

  * Cherry-pick patch from Ryan's sbuild that outputs dpkg --purge output
    line-by-line, instead of as one big blob, to make output on the web
    UI a little bit more friendly for people following along at home.
  * Install a cron.daily script (eww) to purge old build logs for now until
    I have the time to learn how twisted's native log rotation works.

    all the files from debian/files out of the chroot, instead of after.

  * Use dpkg --print-installation-architecture in our postinst instead
    of --print-architecture to avoid spewing suprious error messages.
  * Remove the check for log_dir, since we call sbuild with --nolog,
    and stop creating $HOME/logs in the user setup part of postinst.

  * Update buildd-slave code to allow for GIVENBACK status returns,
    matching the states under which sbuild used to do --auto-give-back.
  * Port over sanae's build log regex parsing to allow us to do:
    - Automatic dep-wait handling, based on sbuild's logs of apt-get.
    - Automatic give-backs for a few corner cases (like kernel bugs).
  * Make sbuild stop dying if we have no sendmail installed, since we
    don't really want it sending mail in the launchpad world anyway.
  * Call sbuild and apt with "LANG=C", so we don't have to worry about
    locales matching between the base system and the autobuild chroots.
  * Clear up confusion in build states with 's/BUILDFAIL/PACKAGEFAIL/'
