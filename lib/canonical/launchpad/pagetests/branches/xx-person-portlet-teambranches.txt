= Person Team Branches Portlet =

The purpose of this portlet is to indiciate that there are teams
that this person participates in that has branches.

The portlet only appears when the persons teams actually have branches,
and only teams that have branches are shown.

None of Sample Person's teams have any branches, so there should
not be a portlet there.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
    >>> portlet = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Branches for')
    >>> print portlet
    None

    >>> print extract_text(portlet)
