= Bazaar Branch Browser Links =

We run a code browsing service at http://codebrowse.launchpad.net for
branches that are hosted or mirrored by Launchpad.  A link to the
codebrowse page for a branch is included in the actions menu on the
branch page.

Lets look at the link for one of the registered branches:

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility, queryAdapter
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import IContextMenu

  >>> branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).get(1)
  >>> print branch.unique_name
  ~name12/firefox/main

  >>> def getBrowseLink(branch):
  ...     menu = queryAdapter(branch, IContextMenu)
  ...     for link in menu.iterlinks():
  ...         if link.name == 'browse':
  ...             return link
  ...     raise AssertionError('No browse link found')

  >>> link = getBrowseLink(branch)
  >>> print link.text
  Browse code
  >>> print link.url
  http://codebrowse.launchpad.net/~name12/firefox/main
  >>> print link.enabled
  False

For this branch, the link is disabled because no revisions have been
published:

  >>> print branch.last_mirrored_id
  None


When the branch is published by the branch puller, last_mirrored_id is
set to a non-NULL value.  When this occurs, the browse link is
enabled:

  >>> branch.last_mirrored_id = 'foo'
  >>> link = getBrowseLink(branch)
  >>> print link.enabled
  True
