If a branch fails to mirror, that information is displayed in the mirror's
page, together with the last failure message we got when mirroring.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/jblack/+branch/+junk/devel-1.0 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Launchpad could not mirror this branch...
  ...I do not like Arch, so I am pretending it failed to mirror...

If a branch failed to mirror but no failure message was stored, we properly
report the absence of an error message.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/stevea/+branch/thunderbird/main HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Launchpad could not mirror this branch...
  ...No error message...


Ultimately, if a branch was successfully mirrored, then we obviously won't
display any failure-related information.

  >>> gnome_terminal_page = str(http(r"""
  ... GET /people/name12/+branch/gnome-terminal/2.6 HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  >>> "Launchpad could not mirror this branch" in gnome_terminal_page
  False
