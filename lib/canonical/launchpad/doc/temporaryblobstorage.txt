Temporary Blob Storage
======================

Launchpad allows users to upload a BLOB, which will be stored for a short
time, before being deleted. This upload can be done anonymously, and the
user is given a "ticket" that is unique and which allows them to point at
that blob during a subsequent transaction.

For example, a system that needs to file a bug, and attach a file to the
bug, could submit a structured BLOB to Launchpad, then start the bug filing
process with a pointer to that BLOB. The bug filing code could then
retrieve, parse and include the contents of the BLOB in the bug report,
perhaps as attachments.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITemporaryStorageManager
    >>> tsm = getUtility(ITemporaryStorageManager)

To create a new TemporaryBlob, use ITemporaryStorageManager.new:

    >>> uuid = tsm.new('abcdefg')
    >>> uuid is not None
    True

To retrieve a blob, we can also use the tsm:

    >>> blob = tsm.fetch(uuid)
    >>> blob.blob
    u'abcdefg'
