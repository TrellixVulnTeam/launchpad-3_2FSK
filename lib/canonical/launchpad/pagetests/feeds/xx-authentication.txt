= Authentication for feeds =

Requests made to feeds.launchpad.dev are not challenged for
authentication, so most access is done anonymously.  In the event a
request provides basic authentication, even though not requested by
the server, the web application will nonetheless use the
unauthenticated anonymous user for all interaction.

    # Setup a Foo Bar user and let Zope handle the errors.
    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.handleErrors = True

    # First, get the bug through the web site, to ensure the
    # bug exists and is private.
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/14')
    >>> print browser.url
    http://bugs.launchpad.dev/jokosher/+bug/14

    # Traversing to the private bug will trigger an Unauthorized error.
    # For feeds, this will result in a Forbidden error.  This test
    # ensures FeedsUnauthorizedError works and that the unauthorized
    # user is the current user.
    >>> browser.open('http://feeds.launchpad.dev/bugs/14/bug.atom')
