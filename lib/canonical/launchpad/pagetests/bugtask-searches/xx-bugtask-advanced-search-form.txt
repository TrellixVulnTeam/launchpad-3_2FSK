= Advanced Search Form =

The advanced search form allows searching for bugs within a target by
supplying many different criteria.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+bugs?advanced=1')

== Searching by Assignee ==

To search bugs by assignee, we can select from two options: `Nobody`
(bugs that aren't assigned) or by a specific user name.

=== Assignee field and radio button behaviour ===

When searching by username we need to both select the coresponding
radio button and enter a valid user name. The username input
automatically selects the coresponding radio button when we type some
text into it by calling the selectWidget Javascript function.

    >>> assignee_widget = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'field.assignee')
    >>> print assignee_widget['onkeypress']
    selectWidget('assignee_option', event)
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'assignee_option')
    <input...type="radio"...>
