    <h1>Adding a new series</h1>
    <p>
      This page creates a new distribution series. The series can
      later be renamed and initialized with packages from a parent
      series.
    </p>
    <h2 id="codename">Code name</h2>
    <p>
      The code name for the new distribution series will form part of
      its URL, so choose carefully. The new series is also referenced
      by its code name throughout Launchpad while it's in a
      non-released state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the series is released, its version is used instead in
      titles, etc.
