= LowerCaseTextWidget =

This custom widget is used to convert strings to lower case.

Some fields accept only lower case strings. Instead of displaying an error
message when the user inputs an upper case string, a LowerCaseTextWidget can be
used to automatically convert the input to lower case:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBug
  >>> from canonical.widgets.textwidgets import LowerCaseTextWidget
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> field = IBug['description']
  >>> request = TestRequest(form={'field.description':'FooBar'})
  >>> widget = LowerCaseTextWidget(field, request)
  >>> widget.getInputValue()
  u'foobar'

However, strings without lower case characters are left unchanged:

  >>> field = IBug['description']
  >>> request = TestRequest(form={'field.description':'wibble123'})
  >>> widget = LowerCaseTextWidget(field, request)
  >>> widget.getInputValue()
  u'wibble123'

In addition, the widget also renders itself with a CSS style that causes
characters to be rendered in lower case as they are typed in by the user:

  >>> widget.cssClass
  'lowerCaseText'

This style is defined by "lib/canonical/launchpad/icing/style.css". Note that
the style only causes text to be rendered in lower case, and does not convert
the underlying string to lower case.
