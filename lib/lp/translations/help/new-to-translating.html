    <h1>Tips for new translators</h1>

    <p>
      If you're new to translating using Launchpad, there are a few things you
      might find it useful to know.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You can <a href="/people/+me/+editlanguages" target="_blank">tell
        Launchpad which languages you prefer to work in</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can help any of hundreds of projects that use Launchpad to
        translate their software. Also, you can help translate distributions,
        such as Ubuntu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each project/distribution decides how to balance openness with the
        need for review of translations by selecting a <a
        href="/+help-translations/permissions-policies.html">permissions policy</a>. For
        most projects, you'll be able to suggest translations that will then
        be reviewed by someone else.
      </li>
    </ul>
