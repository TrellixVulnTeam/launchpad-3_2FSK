-- Project
COMMENT ON TABLE Project IS 'Project: A DOAP Project. This table is the core of the DOAP section of the Launchpad database. It contains details of a single open source Project and is the anchor point for products, potemplates, and translationefforts.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Project.owner IS 'The owner of the project will initially be the person who creates this Project in the system. We will encourage upstream project leaders to take on this role. The Project owner is able to edit the project and appoint project administrators (administrators are recorded in the ProjectRole table).';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Project.homepageurl IS 'The home page URL of this project. Note that this could well be the home page of the main product of this project as well, if the project is too small to have a separate home page for project and product.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Project.wikiurl IS 'This is the URL of a wiki that includes information about the project. It might be a page in a bigger wiki, or it might be the top page of a wiki devoted to this project.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Project.lastdoap IS 'This column stores a cached copy of the last DOAP description we saw for this project. We cache the last DOAP fragment for this project because there may be some aspects of it which we are unable to represent in the database (such as multiple homepageurl\'s instead of just a single homepageurl) and storing the DOAP file allows us to re-parse it later and recover this information when our database model has been updated appropriately.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Project.name IS 'A short lowercase name uniquely identifying the product. Use cases include being used as a key in URL traversal.';


-- Product
COMMENT ON TABLE Product IS 'Product: a DOAP Product. This table stores core information about an open source product. In Launchpad, anything that can be shipped as a tarball would be a product, and in some cases there might be products for things that never actually ship, depending on the project. For example, most projects will have a \'website\' product, because that allows you to file a Malone bug against the project website. Note that these are not actual product releases, which are stored in the ProductRelease table.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.owner IS 'The Product owner would typically be the person who createed this product in Launchpad. But we will encourage the upstream maintainer of a product to become the owner in Launchpad. The Product owner can edit any aspect of the Product, as well as appointing people to specific roles with regard to the Product (see the ProductRole table). Also, the owner can add a new ProductRelease and also edit Rosetta POTemplates associated with this product.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.project IS 'Every Product belongs to one and only one Project, which is referenced in this column.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.listurl IS 'This is the URL where information about a mailing list for this Product can be found. The URL might point at a web archive or at the page where one can subscribe to the mailing list.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.programminglang IS 'This field records, in plain text, the name of any significant programming languages used in this product. There are no rules, conventions or restrictions on this field at present, other than basic sanity. Examples might be "Python", "Python, C" and "Java".';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.downloadurl IS 'The download URL for a Product should be the best place to download that product, typically off the relevant Project web site. This should not point at the actual file, but at a web page with download information.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.lastdoap IS 'This column stores a cached copy of the last DOAP description we saw for this product. See the Project.lastdoap field for more info.';
-- COMMENT ON COLUMN Product.manifest IS 'The Product manifest, if it exists, tells us exactly which branches are combined to make up the source of this product. Manifests are a Sourcerer invention, mainly used for distribution packaging, but they can apply equally well to an upstream Product. If a manifest exists for this product then this field points to it.';


-- ProductSeries
COMMENT ON TABLE ProductSeries IS 'A ProductSeries is a set of product releases that are related to a specific version of the product. Typically, each major release of the product starts a new ProductSeries. These often map to a branch in the revision control system of the project, such as "2_0_STABLE". A few conventional Series names are "head" for releases of the HEAD branch, "1.0" for releases with version numbers like "1.0.0" and "1.0.1".';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ProductSeries.name IS 'The name of the ProductSeries is like a unix name, it should not contain any spaces and should start with a letter or number. Good examples are "2.0", "3.0-stable", "head" and "development".';

-- EmailAddress
COMMENT ON COLUMN EmailAddress.email IS 'An email address used by a Person. The email address is stored in a casesensitive way, but must be case insensitivly unique.';
