= Things a person is working on =

Any person page contains the bugs/blueprints a person is working on.

Sample Person is not working on any bugs/blueprints right now, so the section
won't be displayed.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'working-on')
    None

Carlos is working on a blueprint, so the section does appear on his
profile page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~carlos/')
    >>> div = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'working-on')
    >>> for tag in div.findAll('tr'):
    ...     print tag.find('a').renderContents()
    Support Native SVG Objects

There is a link to see all assigned blueprints that any user may see.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Show all assigned blueprints').click()
    >>> anon_browser.title
    'Blueprints involving Carlos Perell\xc3\xb3 Mar\xc3\xadn'
