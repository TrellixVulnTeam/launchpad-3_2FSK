= Commercial Subscriptions =

The CommercialSubscription class is used to track whether a project,
which does not qualify for free hosting, has an unexpired subscription.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     ICommercialSubscription, IProductSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, ANONYMOUS
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

An open source project should not have a commercial subscription,
indicated by 'None'.

    >>> product_set = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> bzr = product_set.getByName('bzr')
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription
    None

Redeem a voucher and check that the commercial_subscription
attribute is correct.

    >>> owner = bzr.owner
    >>> owner.isTeam()
    False
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('asdf123', owner, owner, 12, 'notes')
    >>> verifyObject(ICommercialSubscription, bzr.commercial_subscription)
    True
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.product.name
    bzr
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    asdf123

The expiration date can be extended by redeeming another voucher.  In
real life this would be done nearer to the expiration date.

    >>> from datetime import timedelta
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> old_date_starts = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 12, 'notes')
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    foo456

The start date should not have changed.

    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts == old_date_starts
    True

The difference between the expiration dates should be one year, either
365 days or 366 days during leap years.

    >>> expiry_diff = (bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires -
    ...                old_date_expires)
    >>> expiry_diff in [timedelta(365), timedelta(366)]
    True

A voucher can be redeemed for any number of months (as reported by the
Salesforce proxy).

    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> old_date_starts = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo457', owner, owner, 6, 'notes')
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    foo457

The start date did not change.

    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts == old_date_starts
    True

The expiration date has been increased by six months, which can be
anywhere between 181 days and 184 days, depending on the start date.

    >>> expiry_diff = (bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires -
    ...                old_date_expires)
    >>> timedelta(181) <= expiry_diff <= timedelta(184)
    True
