= Karam for branch related activity =

We want people to register their branches on Launchpad, and also to
link their branches to bugs and specs, so we give them some karma for
it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.karma import KarmaCategory
    >>> code_category = KarmaCategory.byName('code')
    >>> code_karma_actions = code_category.karmaactions
    >>> sorted([action.title for action in code_karma_actions])
    []

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.karma import KarmaAssignedEventListener
    >>> karma_helper = KarmaAssignedEventListener(show_person=True)
    >>> karma_helper.register_listener()

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> b = factory.makeBranch()
