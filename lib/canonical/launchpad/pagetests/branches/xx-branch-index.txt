= Branch Details =

== Recent Revisions ==

On the Code site, registered branches are reached by
/<owner>/<product>/<branch-name>.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/+branch/+junk/junk.dev')
  >>> main = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'mainarea')


=== Heading ===

We display the recent revisions of a branch if it has been scanned. There's a
"Recent revisions" heading:

  >>> for heading in main.fetch('h2'):
  ...     print heading.renderContents()
  Recent revisions
  ...


=== Revision information ===

Underneath that heading we see the ten most-recent revisions of the branch in
reverse-chronological order.

  >>> for heading in main.fetch('h3'):
  ...    print heading.renderContents()
  Revision 6 by foo &lt;foo@localhost&gt; (2005-10-31)
  Revision 5 by foo &lt;foo@localhost&gt; (2005-10-31)
  Revision 4 by Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; (2005-10-31)
  Revision 3 by Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; (2005-10-31)
  Revision 2 by Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; (2005-10-31)
  Revision 1 by Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; (2005-10-31)


=== Excursis ===

In terms of HTML, each commit is contained in a <div> with an id of "revN",
where "N" is the revision sequence number.

The revision number, author and date are all contained in a heading (h3), and
the commit message follows as a number of paragraphs.

  >>> def get_commit_message(sequence):
  ...     revision = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'rev%s' % (sequence,))
  ...     return revision.fetch('p')


=== Commit messages ===

The commit message is displayed in paragraphs underneath the revision id and
author.

  >>> for paragraph in get_commit_message(6):
  ...     print paragraph.renderContents()
  fix bug in bar


When a commit message refers to a bug using the form "bug <bugnumber>", a link
to that bug is created.

  >>> for paragraph in get_commit_message(3):
  ...     print paragraph.renderContents()
  fix <a ...>bug 1</a>


This link can be followed to the bug's details page.

  >>> browser.getLink('bug 1').click()
  >>> print browser.title
  Bug #1 in firefox (upstream)...
