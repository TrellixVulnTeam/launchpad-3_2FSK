Security Teams
==============

Responsibility for security-related bugs, whether undisclosed or public,
are modelled in Launchpad by having a "security contact" on a
Distribution or a Product.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).get(1)
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).get(4)

Security contacts are set with simple attributes.
