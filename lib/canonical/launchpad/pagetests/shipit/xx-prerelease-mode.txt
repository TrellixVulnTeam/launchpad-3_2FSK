= Pre-release mode =

We always open shipit a couple weeks before every new Ubuntu release, so
that users can pre-order CDs and have them shipped as soon as the release is
out.  We need to make it clear in the UI that these are pre-orders so that
users are aware it may take a bit longer than the usual for the delivery.

This is controlled by a config option, which allows us to easily flip the
switch once the release is out and we move from pre-release to normal mode.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.shipit.prerelease_mode
    False

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://shipit.ubuntu.dev')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'chooseLinks'))
    I want to download...
    I want to request CDs of...

    >>> config.shipit.prerelease_mode = True
    >>> anon_browser.reload()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'chooseLinks'))
    I want to download and test the beta version of...
    I want to pre-order CDs of...

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic karl@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://shipit.ubuntu.dev/myrequest')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents).h1)
    Pre-order Ubuntu ...

    >>> print get_feedback_messages(browser.contents)[0]
    Ubuntu...has not been released yet, but we'll record your request...

Restore the prerelease_mode config variable so that we don't screw up other
tests.

    >>> config.shipit.prerelease_mode = False
