   Buildd Slave
   ============

  Buildd Slave is an application independent of Launchpad Database, so
  it has its own configuration file and depends only of sbuild package

  It consists basically of an wrapper of sbuild process through an XMLRPC
  Server interface. It requires read access to the current Librarian machine 
  to download needed files for the build job.

  See more initialization details in canonical/buildd/ftests/harness.py

  >>> from canonical.buildd.ftests import BuilddSlaveTestSetup
   
  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

  Use simple xmlrpclib client to certify the BuildSlave is running

  >>> import xmlrpclib
  >>> s = xmlrpclib.Server('http://localhost:8221/')
  >>> s.echo('Hello World')
  ['Hello World']

  Tested, time to shutdown

  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()


  # XXX cprov 20050630
  # As soon as we have better control of the environment we can try to
  # simulate the some certified build job, maybe the historical 'at'
  # that build even 'under the water'.
