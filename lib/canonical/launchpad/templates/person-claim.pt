  <h1>Claim &#8220;<span tal:replace="context/browsername" />&#8221;
    in Launchpad</h1>

  <p>
    Launchpad's record for <span tal:replace="context/browsername" /> was
    created on <span tal:replace="context/datecreated/fmt:date" /> when
    <span tal:replace="context/creation_comment" />.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're <span tal:replace="context/browsername" />, relax! You don't
    need to do anything, and we'll never spam you. But claiming this
    profile will let you edit your contact details, register your own
    products and code branches in Launchpad, and use Launchpad to
    <strong>collaborate with other developers</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To claim the profile, enter one of the e-mail addresses it is
    associated with. (We're not showing you the list of addresses to
    protect <span tal:replace="context/browsername" />'s privacy in case
    you’re someone else.) We’ll e-mail that address to ask your confirmation.
