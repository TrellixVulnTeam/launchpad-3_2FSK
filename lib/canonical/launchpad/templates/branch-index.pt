  <p>Launchpad is integrated with the <a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> version control system. (<a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/WhyUseBzr">Why use Bazaar?</a>).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mirror branches are primarily hosted somewhere else on the internet.
      You can register a mirror branch from the page of a person or of a
      product. Launchpad will create a mirror of this branch and pull changes
      every day from the URL provided in the branch details.</li>

    <li>Upload branches are primarily hosted on Launchpad. You can create an
      upload branch using <code>bzr push</code> with an URL on
      <code>sftp://bazaar.launchpad.net</code>. There is a latency of up to 10
      minutes between the time branch data is uploaded to Launchpad and the
      time when it is published.</li>
   </ul>

  <p>Only the registrant of a branch is allowed to edit the registry details.
    Upload branches can only be written to by the registrant. But the
    registrant can be a team. If you wish to allow other people to edit details
    or upload data, you can reassign a branch to a team.</p>

  <p>The URL of the branch on <code>bazaar.launchpad.net</code> is based on the
    short name of the registrant, product and branch. If you change any of
    those short names or assign the branch to a different product or person or
    team, the URL will change.</p>

  <p>Subscribing to a branch will make it appear in your personal branch
    listings.</p>

  <p>Once you have registered or uploaded a branch, it cannot be deleted. But
    you can set its status to &ldquo;Abandoned&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>A mirror branch cannot be converted to an upload branch, and conversely,
    you cannot convert an upload branch to a mirror branch. However you can
    rename a branch and create a new one in its place.<p>

  <p>There no browsable web content on <code>bazaar.launchpad.net<code>. This
    host only serves data for use with the Bazaar version control system.</p>
