        <h3>About the Blueprint Tracker</h3>

        <p>Code isn't the only part of your project that can benefit from open
           development. Launchpad's unique Blueprint Tracker lets anyone
           suggest and discuss ideas for your project.
        </p>

        <p>You can accept or reject blueprints, prioritise and assign their
           development to particular team members, schedule development at
           sprints and tie them to specific releases. The Blueprint Tracker
           reduces the barriers to participating in your project and gives you
           a simple way to track new features from idea to release.
