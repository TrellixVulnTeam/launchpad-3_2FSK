Source Packages
===============

A source package is a thing from which binary packages are built, to then be
installed using a package management tool like apt-get or rpm. One named source
package in a distro may be used to build several different named binary
packages, on one or more architectures. One named binary package in a distro
may have been built from more than one named source package (e.g. a different
source package may have been used to build "foo" on i386 vs. "foo" on ppc.)

Named Source Package
--------------------

The are various metadata we're interested in collecting about a bundle of code
used to build binary packages for installation in a particular distro release.
One such thing is the name of that bundle of code. This is abstracted into a
separate SourcePackageName table.

Accessing source package names is done through the ISourcePackageNameSet
utility.

The ISourcePackageNameSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISourcePackageNameSet
    >>> sourcepackagenameset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)

To retrieve a specific source package name, use ISourcePackageNameSet.get:

    >>> firefox = sourcepackagenameset.get(1)
    >>> print firefox.name
    mozilla-firefox
