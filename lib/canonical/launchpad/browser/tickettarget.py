            # SteveA says:
            # First, a collection of ideas for discussion:
            #   the request actually has just the information needed for this,
            #   but in a private variable request._traversed_names -- a list
            #   of the names traversed.  So it would be better to check the
            #   last element of that list to get the name.
            #   Otherwise, perhaps view classes should know what name they are
            #   registered for in zcml.
            #   Otherwise, we can use some trivial subclasses of
            #   TicketTargetView that each have a getTickets() method.  In
            #   zcml, the appropriate subclass is registered.  This decouples
            #   the name traversed to from the intent of what tickets should
            #   be shown.
            # Now, the best solution, moving forwards:
            #   Either wait for the Zope 3 improvement I'm on the hook to
            #   land that makes templates called "template" in view classes,
            #   or include it manually like Zope 3 will do in the future.

            #   pages.
