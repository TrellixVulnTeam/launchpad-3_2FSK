= Person and the Support Tracker =

== searchTickets() ==

IPerson defines a searchTickets() method which can be used to
select all or a subset of the support requests in which the person is
involved. This includes tickets which the person created, is assigned
to, is subscribed to, commented on, or answered. Various subsets can
be selected by using the following criteria status, search_text and
participation type.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> foo_bar = personset.getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')

=== search_text ===

The search_text parameter will limit the tickets to those matching
the query using the regular full text algorithm.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(search_text='firefox'):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck              Open
    mailto: problem in webpage                      Solved
    Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used Open

=== sort ===

When using the search_text criteria, the default is to sort the results
by relevancy. One can use the sort parameter to change that. It takes
one of the constant defined in the TicketSort enumeration.

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketSort
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         search_text='firefox', sort=TicketSort.NEWEST_FIRST):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    mailto: problem in webpage                      Solved
    Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used Open
    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck              Open

When no text search is done, the default sort order is
TicketSort.NEWEST_FIRST.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets():
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title

    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck                      Open

=== status ===

The last searches showed that by default, not all statuses are searched
for by default (they excluded expired and invalid tickets). The status
parameter can be used to control the list of statuses to select:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketStatus
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(status=TicketStatus.INVALID):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM   Invalid

The status parameter can also take a list of statuses.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         status=[TicketStatus.SOLVED, TicketStatus.INVALID]):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    mailto: problem in webpage                  Solved
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM   Invalid

=== participation ===

By default, any types of relationship to a ticket is considered by
searchTickets. This can customized through the participation parameter.
It takes one or a list of constants from the TicketParticipation enumeration.

To select only tickets on which the person commented, the
TicketParticipation.COMMENTER is used:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketParticipation
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.COMMENTER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    Continue playing after shutdown
    Play DVDs in Totem
    mailto: problem in webpage
    Installation of Java Runtime Environment for Mozilla
    Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used

TicketParticipation.SUBSCRIBER will only select the tickets to which
the person is subscribed to:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.SUBSCRIBER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    Slow system
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM

TicketParticipation.OWNER selects the tickets that the person created:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.OWNER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    Slow system
    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM

TicketParticipation.ANSWERER selects the tickets for which the person
was marked as the answerer:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.ANSWERER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    mailto: problem in webpage
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM

TicketParticipation.ASSIGNEE selects that tickets which are assigned to
the person:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.ASSIGNEE, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title

If a list of these constants is used, all of these participation types
will be selected:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=[
    ...             TicketParticipation.OWNER, TicketParticipation.ANSWERER],
    ...         status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    mailto: problem in webpage
    Slow system
    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM

=== language ===

By default, tickets in all languages are included in the results. It is
possible to filter tickets by the language they were writtenin . One or
a list of ILanguage object should be passed in the language parameter to
specify the language filter.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> spanish = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['es']
    >>> english = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en']

Foo bar doesn't have any tickets written in Spanish.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(language=spanish):
    ...     print ticket.title

But carlos has one.

    >>> carlos = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('carlos')
    >>> for ticket in carlos.searchTickets(
    ...     language=[english, spanish]):
    ...     [ticket.title, ticket.language.code]
    [u'Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp (doble-n\xfacleo)',
     u'es']

=== Combination ===

The returned sets of tickets is the intersection of the sets delimited
by each criteria:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         search_text='firefox OR Java', status=TicketStatus.OPEN,
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.COMMENTER):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    Installation of Java Runtime Environment for Mozilla    Open
    Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used         Open

== ticket_languages ==

IPerson also defines a ticket_languages attribute which contains the set
of languages used by all of the tickets in which this person is
involved.

    >>> sorted(language.code for language in foo_bar.ticket_languages)
    [u'en']

This includes tickets which the person owns. But also, tickets that the
user subscribed to.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITicketSet
    >>> pt_BR_ticket = getUtility(ITicketSet).get(13)
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> pt_BR_ticket.subscribe(foo_bar)
    <TicketSubscription...>

    >>> sorted(language.code for language in foo_bar.ticket_languages)
    [u'en', u'pt_BR']

And also tickets for which he's the answerer.

    >>> es_ticket = getUtility(ITicketSet).get(12)
    >>> es_ticket.reject(foo_bar, 'Reject ticket.')
    <TicketMessage...>

    >>> sorted(language.code for language in foo_bar.ticket_languages)
    [u'en', u'es', u'pt_BR']

As well, as ticket which are assigned to the user.

    >>> pt_BR_ticket.assignee = carlos
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> sorted(language.code for language in carlos.ticket_languages)
    [u'es', u'pt_BR']

And tickets on which the user commented:

    >>> en_ticket = getUtility(ITicketSet).get(1)
    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')
    >>> en_ticket.addComment(carlos, 'A simple comment.')
    <TicketMessage...>

    >>> sorted(language.code for language in carlos.ticket_languages)
    [u'en', u'es', u'pt_BR']
