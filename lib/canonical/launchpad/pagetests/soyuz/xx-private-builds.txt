= Private Builds =

A build is considered private if it is a build being done in an IArchive that
is marked as private.  Private builds will not be apparent anywhere in the
UI.  There are several places where information can be presented
differently depending on whether the user is permitted to see the build
or not.  A permitted user is one who is the archive's owner, a member of
its team, a BuilddAdministrator or a Launchpad administrator.


== Builder portlet details and builder index page ==

The builder-portlet-details portlet appears on the builder +index page
and usually shows some status information (see 20-builder-index.txt).
This status information is changed to not reveal build details if a
private build is taking place.  Instead the builder is reported as NOT OK
(meaning it's unavailable).

We'll make a private archive and add a build to it to demonstrate this.
"cprov" has got some builds in the sample data already, we'll add one to
the "frog" builder.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBuilderSet, IBuildSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.buildqueue import BuildQueue
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("cprov")
    >>> cprov.archive.buildd_secret = "secret"
    >>> cprov.archive.private = True
    >>> cprov_builds = getUtility(
    ...     IBuildSet).getBuildsForArchive(cprov.archive)
    >>> frog = getUtility(IBuilderSet)['frog']
    >>> frog.builderok = True
    >>> random_build = 2
    >>> trash = BuildQueue(build=cprov_builds[random_build], builder=frog)
    >>> random_build_id = cprov_builds[random_build].id

We'll also make name12 a member of the launchpad-buildd-admins team, so we
can use him to see builds from a buildd-admin perspective.

    >>> name12 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("name12")
    >>> buildd_admins = getUtility(
    ...     IPersonSet).getByName("launchpad-buildd-admins")
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.person import (
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus)
    >>> buildd_admins.addMember(
    ...     name12, reviewer=name12, status=TeamMembershipStatus.APPROVED)

Finally, we will remove any publications of the source behind our
build of interest that are not in cprov's archive, so that we know
we're dealing with a single private source publication.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> random_spr = cprov_builds[random_build].sourcepackagerelease
    >>> non_cprov_publications = [
    ...     pub for pub in random_spr.publishings if pub.archive != cprov]
    >>> for pub in non_cprov_publications:
    ...     discard = pub.supersede()

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

So now we can go to frog's builder page and see what the portlet shows us.
The status shown to an anonymous user hides the fact that it's building a
private build:

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog")
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building private build
    ...

and also the main area:

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    The frog builder
    Current status
    The frog builder
    is deactivated.
    Last updated ...


Launchpad Administrators are allowed to see the build in the portlet:

    >>> admin_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog")
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(admin_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building i386 build of ... RELEASE [cprov]
    ...

and also the main area:

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents))
    The frog builder
    Current status
    i386 build of iceweasel 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...

Buildd Administrators are not allowed to see the build in the portlet:

    >>> name12_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> name12_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog")
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(name12_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building private build
    ...

and also the main area:

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(name12_browser.contents))
    The frog builder
    Current status
    The frog builder is deactivated.
    ...

cprov is also allowed to see his own build in the portlet:

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:cprov")
    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog")
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(cprov_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building i386 build of ... RELEASE [cprov]
    ...

and also the main area:

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(cprov_browser.contents))
    The frog builder
    Current status
    i386 build of iceweasel 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...

IBuild is also wrapped in a Zope security proxy to prevent unauthorised
access.  This prevents direct access to the build URL by unauthorised
users:

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...     random_build_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized...

But it is fine for authorised users:

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...     random_build_id)
    >>> print cprov_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/...


== Builder history page ==

The builder history page (+builds/<builder>/+history) shows all the builds
that the builder has done, with filtering on a user-selected build state
(see 20-builder-index.txt).

This list does not include builds that are private if a non-privileged
user is viewing it.

The builder "bob" has lots of builds in the sample data, including some
for cprov's private archive.  We can visit bob's history page and see
what it shows a non-privileged user:

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/bob/+history")
    >>> [builds_list] = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     anon_browser.contents, 'builds_list')
    >>> print extract_text(builds_list)
    Package:
    ...
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu breezy-autotest RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of foobar 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of netapplet 0.99.6-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    5 of 14 results
    ...

Now visit the same page as an admin we can see that there are four more
results in the total set of results with an extra "mozilla-firefox"
build at the top of the first batch.

    >>> admin_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/bob/+history")
    >>> [builds_list] = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     admin_browser.contents, 'builds_list')
    >>> print extract_text(builds_list)
    Package:
    ...
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu breezy-autotest RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    5 of 17 results
    ...

If cprov browses the list he will also see his own builds in the list.

    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/bob/+history")
    >>> [builds_list] = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     cprov_browser.contents, 'builds_list')
    >>> print extract_text(builds_list)
    Package:
    ...
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu breezy-autotest RELEASE
    ...
    i386 build of cdrkit 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    ...
    5 of 17 results
    ...

"Frog" is currently building a private build but again the unauthorised user
cannot see any of the private details.

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog/+history")
    >>> [builds_list] = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     anon_browser.contents, 'builds_list')
    >>> print extract_text(builds_list)
    Package:
    ...
    No build records.

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building private build
    ...

An authorised user will see the build however:

    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds/frog/+history")
    >>> [builds_list] = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     cprov_browser.contents, 'builds_list')
    >>> print extract_text(builds_list)
    Package:
    ...
    No build records.

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(cprov_browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
    The frog builder details
    ...
    Status Building i386 build of ... RELEASE [cprov]
    ...


== Build farm index page ==

The build farm index page at /+builds is described in detail at
xx-buildfarm-index.txt.  However, if a private build is running on
a builder then it is hidden as in the examples above.

An admin user can see builds even if they are private:

    >>> admin_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    Register a new build machine
    PPA build machines
    386      0 builds waiting in queue

    Official distribution build machines
    386      1 builds waiting in queue
    bob    AUTO    Disabled
    Generated at ...

Launchpad Buildd admins cannot see private builds.

    >>> name12_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(name12_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    Register a new build machine
    PPA build machines
    386      0 builds waiting in queue

    Official distribution build machines
    386      1 builds waiting in queue
    bob    AUTO    Disabled
    Generated at ...

cprov can see his own private build:

    >>> cprov_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(cprov_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    Register a new build machine

    386      1 builds waiting in queue
    bob    AUTO    Disabled
    Generated at ...

Anonymous users cannot see the private build:

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    PPA build machines

== Unembargoed builds ==

When private packages are copied to a non-private archive, the build
becomes unembargoed and is accessible by any user.

Currently, browsing to the build page is forbidden for unauthorised
users:

    >>> from zope.security.interfaces import Unauthorized
    >>> try:
    ...     anon_browser.open(
    ...         "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...         random_build_id)
    ... except Unauthorized:
    ...     print "Got expected exception"
    ... else:
    ...     print "Did not get expected exception"
    Got expected exception

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test")
    >>> try:
    ...     browser.open(
    ...         "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...         random_build_id)
    ... except Unauthorized:
    ...     print "Got expected exception"
    ... else:
    ...     print "Did not get expected exception"
    Got expected exception

Let's make the iceweasel package available in Warty.  First log in as
an admin to be able to manipulate the source publishing.

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> [source_pub] = cprov.archive.getPublishedSources(name="iceweasel")
    >>> new_pub = source_pub.copyTo(
    ...     warty, source_pub.pocket, ubuntu.main_archive)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

Now the anonymous user can see the build:

    >>> anon_browser = setupBrowser()
    >>> anon_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    PPA build machines
    386      0 builds waiting in queue
    frog  AUTO    Building i386 build of iceweasel 1.0 in ubuntu
                      warty RELEASE [cprov]
    Official distribution build machines
    386      1 builds waiting in queue
    bob   AUTO    Disabled
    Generated at ...

Any other logged-in user will also see the build:

    >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/+builds")
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
    Launchpad build machines
    PPA build machines
    386     0 builds waiting in queue
    frog    AUTO
    Building i386 build of iceweasel 1.0 in ubuntu warty RELEASE [cprov]
    Official distribution build machines
    386     1 builds waiting in queue
    bob AUTO    Disabled
    Generated at ...

Accessing the build page will now also work:

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...     random_build_id)
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    i386 build of iceweasel...

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+ppa/default/+build/%s" %
    ...     random_build_id)
    >>> print browser.title
    i386 build of iceweasel...
