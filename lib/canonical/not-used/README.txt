Unused code
===========

Code under lib/canonical/not-used/ is not used.  It may have ended up here
because it lacks tests, and no one is available to maintain it.  So, it is
better taken out of the main code-base.

Code is put into lib/canonical/not-used/ rather than archived on some arch
branch, so that its existence is still easily noted.
