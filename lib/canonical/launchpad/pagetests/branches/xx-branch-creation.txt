= Creating branches =

In the past, there were two very distinct ways of creating branches
in Launchpad.  The first was to use the UI, and the other was to
push the branch to Launchpad.  The first method only created MIRRORED
branches, and the second only HOSTED.

Many users were confused with this, and tried to create HOSTED branches
using the user interface.  Now they can.


== Creating a hosted branch ==

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/launchpad')
    >>> browser.getLink('Register branch').click()
