  <p>Launchpad is integrated with the <a

  <p>This page lists all the branches that are associated to a product. There,
     you can see what code contributions are being worked on or proposed for
     inclusion in this product.</p>

  <p>Although it is possible for a branch not to be associated to any product,
    we recommend against using this feature: such branches are harder to
    locate. Associating your branches to the right product makes it easier for
    other developers to locate your contributions.</p>

  <p>From this page you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Browse to every listed branch.</li>

    <li>See this listing in a more detailed format.</li>

    <li>Register a new mirror branch associated to this product.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To create an <em>upload</em> branch, that is a branch hosted on Launchpad,
    as opposed to a <em>mirror</em> branch:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Register a SSH key from your person&rsquo;s page. Click on your name at
      the top of any Launchpad page when logged in to go to your person's
      page.</li>

    <li>Use the <code>bzr push</code> command to create the branch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The push location must be of the form:
    <code>sftp://<i>login</i><wbr></wbr>@bazaar.launchpad.net/<wbr></wbr>~<i>registrant</i>/<wbr></wbr><i>product</i>/<wbr></wbr><i>branch</i></code></p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>login</i> is your Launchpad person name: the last part of the URL of
      your person's page. Launchpad uses it to check the SSH key you are
      authenticating with.</li>

    <li><i>registrant</i> is your Launchpad person name, or the name of a team
       you belong to. Use a team name to create a branch to which other people
       can upload.</li>

    <li><i>product</i> is the name of the Launchpad product to register this
       branch on. The uploaded branch will appear in the listings for this
       product.</li>

    <li><i>name</i> must be unique for a given registrant and product.</li>
  </ul>
