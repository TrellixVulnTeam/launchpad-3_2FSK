= Translation Export Queue =

The Translation Export Queue is the functionality that allows us to export
translation resources from the Launchpad portal.


== ExportResult ==

ExportResult class is used to control the list of exported files that succeed
and the ones that failed with the error associated.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.services.mail.stub import test_emails
    >>> from lp.translations.scripts.po_export_queue import ExportResult
    >>> from lp.translations.tests.helpers import print_mail_subject_and_body
    >>> import logging
    >>> logger = logging.getLogger()

When there is an error, the system will notify it.

To note error messages with the failure file, it should happen inside an
exception handling so we can get the exception error:

    >>> from lp.translations.model.potemplate import POTemplate
    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(1)
    >>> pofile = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> carlos = personset.getByName('carlos')

    >>> result = ExportResult(carlos, [potemplate, pofile], logger)

Record the error.

  >>> try:
  ...     raise AssertionError, "It's just an error for testing purposes"
  ... except AssertionError:
  ...     result.addFailure()

In this case, there is an error, so there shouldn't be a URL to download
anything, if we set it, the system will fail:

  >>> result.url = 'http://someplace.com/somefile.tar.gz'

Once we are done, we should notify the user that everything failed, but
given that we set a URL, the notification will detect the programming error.
In this example, 'carlos' will be the one that did the request.

  >>> result.notify()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: We cannot have a URL for the export and a failure.

In this case, it should be None, so the notify works.

  >>> result.url = None
  >>> result.notify()

  # We need to commit the transaction to get the emails in the queue.
  >>> transaction.commit()

As usual, when there is an error, two emails should be sent:

  >>> len(test_emails)
  2

  >>> while len(test_emails) > 0:
  ...     from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  ...     if 'carlos@canonical.com' in to_addrs:
  ...         carlos_addrs = to_addrs
  ...         carlos_body = body
  ...     else:
  ...         admins_addrs = to_addrs
  ...         admins_body = body

One is for the user with the error notification.

  >>> print carlos_addrs
  ['carlos@canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(carlos_body)
  Subject: Launchpad translation download: Evolution trunk -
  evolution-2.2 template

  >

And the other to the admins.  This one lists the files that were being
exported as context to help tracking down any bugs.

  >>> print admins_addrs
  ['launchpad-error-reports@lists.canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(admins_body)
  Subject: Launchpad translation download errors: Evolution trunk -

As a special case, some error messages are poisoned with non-ASCII characters
and can't be reported without triggering an error themselves.  Those are
specially handled and reported.

  >>> try:
  ...     raise AssertionError, "Really nasty \xc3 non-ASCII error!"
  ... except AssertionError:
  ...     result.addFailure()
  >>> result.notify()
  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> len(test_emails)
  2

  >>> carlos_body = None
  >>> admins_body = None
  >>> while len(test_emails) > 0:
  ...     from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  ...     if 'carlos@canonical.com' in to_addrs:
  ...         carlos_body = body
  ...     else:
  ...         admins_body = body

The user's notification looks no different from that for an ordinary error.

  >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(carlos_body)
  Subject: Launchpad translation download: Evolution trunk -
  evolution-2.2 template
  > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,
  >
  > Launchpad encountered problems exporting the files you requested.

The one for the administrators, however, does not include the unprintable
exception text.

  >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(admins_body)
  Subject: Launchpad translation download errors: Evolution trunk -
  evolution-2.2 template
  > Hello admins,
  >

  >   http://translations.launchpad.../trunk/+pots/evolution-2.2/+ex=
  > port
  >
  > Failed export request included:
  >   * evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk
  >   * Spanish (es) translation of evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk
  >
  > --

  >


Finally, there is the case when there are no errors at all. This is the usual
case.

  >>> result = ExportResult(carlos, [potemplate, pofile], logger)

As noted before, result.url should be set to the URL where the user can
download the requested files. If we don't set it, the export will fail:

  >>> result.notify()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: On success, an exported URL is expected.

So let's add it:

  >>> result.url = 'http://someplace.com/somefile.tar.gz'

And notify the user.

  >>> result.notify()

  # We need to commit the transaction to get the email in the queue.
  >>> transaction.commit()

In this case, there are no errors, so we should get just a single email

  >>> len(test_emails)
  1

  >>> from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()

  >>> print to_addrs
  ['carlos@canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(body)

== process_queue() ==

This method handles entries from the queue of entries to be exported.

    >>> from lp.translations.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue

First, fill the export queue with entries to be exported.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.poexportrequest import (
    ...     IPOExportRequestSet)
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationfileformat import (
    ...     TranslationFileFormat)
    >>> export_request_set = getUtility(IPOExportRequestSet)

The queue is empty by default.

    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    0

Once a new entry has been added, the queue has content.

    >>> export_request_set.addRequest(
    ...     carlos, potemplates=[potemplate], format=TranslationFileFormat.PO)
    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    1

Once the queue is processed, the queue is empty again.

    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    INFO:...Stored file at http://.../po_evolution-2.2.pot

    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    0

And a confirmation email was sent to carlos, the importer.

    >>> len(test_emails)
    1

The confirmation email shows no errors at all.

    >>> from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
    >>> print to_addrs
    ['carlos@canonical.com']
    >>> print_mail_subject_and_body(body)
    Subject: Launchpad translation download: Evolution trunk -
    evolution-2.2 template
    > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,

Let's have a closer look at what is being exported. Usually all messages are
exported but not all messages are equal. Some messages have been imported
from upstream and then changed, others have been left as they are.
This pofile has both kind of messages.

    >>> potemplate = factory.makePOTemplate()
    >>> pofile = factory.makePOFile('eo', potemplate=potemplate)
    >>> factory.makeTranslation(pofile, 1, "english1", "esperanto1", True)
    >>> factory.makeTranslation(pofile, 2, "english2", "esperanto2", False)

To see what is being exported we need to retrieve the exported file from the
librarian.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.librarianhelpers import (
    ...     get_newest_librarian_file)

Exporting this pofile yields both messages in the resulting file.

    >>> export_request_set.addRequest(
    ...     carlos, pofiles=[pofile], format=TranslationFileFormat.PO)
    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    INFO:root:Stored file at http://...eo.po

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print get_newest_librarian_file().read()
    # Esperanto translation for ...
    ...
    "X-Generator: Launchpad (build ...)\n"
    <BLANKLINE>
    msgid "english1"
    msgstr "esperanto1"
    <BLANKLINE>
    msgid "english2"
    msgstr "esperanto2"
    <BLANKLINE>

Setting the format to POCHANGED yields only the message that was changed
after having been imported.

    >>> export_request_set.addRequest(
    ...     carlos, pofiles=[pofile], format=TranslationFileFormat.POCHANGED)
    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    INFO:root:Stored file at http://...eo.po

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print get_newest_librarian_file().read()
    # IMPORTANT: This file does NOT contain a complete PO file structure.
    # DO NOT attempt to import this file back into Launchpad.
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    msgid "english2"
    msgstr "esperanto2"
    <BLANKLINE>

Two more email notifications were sent, we'd better get rid of them.

    >>> email = test_emails.pop()
    >>> email = test_emails.pop()

Finally, if we try to do an export with an empty queue, we don't do
anything:

    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    >>> len(test_emails)
    0
