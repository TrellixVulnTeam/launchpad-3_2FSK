= Product search for pending bugwatches =

Users can search for product bugs that need a bugwatch to track an
upstream bug. This is a workflow feature for users who are adopting
upstream products. The general flow assumes a bug is marked as 'Affects
upstream', during the first round of triage. Another user can choose
'Show bugs that need to be forwarded to an upstream bug tracker' to
locate the bugs that need a bugwatch setup.


== Common searches on a product's bug page (part 1) ==

No Privileges Person visits the alsa-utils front page on Launchpad.
He wants to link Launchpad bugs to to the upstream bug tracker. He can

    >>> user_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/alsa-utils/')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bugs in ALSA utilities'

    >>> pending_watches_link = user_browser.getLink(
    ...     'need forwarding upstream')
    >>> pending_watches_link.text
    '0 bugs need forwarding upstream'


== Marking and searching for pending bugwatches ==

Sample Person is doing some bug reporting and triage for his adopted
alsa-utils project. He creates two bugs, and uses the 'Affects
upstream project' link to record that the bug is in the upstream
product. He does not provide bug watch information.

    >>> browser.addHeader("Authorization", 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/alsa-utils/')
    >>> browser.getLink('Report a bug').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = 'Test Bug 1'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Further information').value = 'Test Bug 1'
    >>> browser.getControl('Submit').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
    Thank you for your bug report...

    >>> browser.getLink('Also affects project').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     'I just want to register that it is upstream').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Add to Bug Report').click()
    >>> browser.title
    'Bug #... in alsa-utils: ...Test Bug 1...'
