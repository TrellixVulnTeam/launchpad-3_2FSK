The `IProcessorFamilySet` utility allows the look-up of ProcessorFamily
instances by name.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.processor import (
    ...     IProcessorFamilySet)

    >>> pfs = getUtility(IProcessorFamilySet)

The attempt to access a non-existing processor family yields None.

    >>> print pfs.getByName('this-processor-family-does-not-exist')
    None

Conversely, accessing an existing processor family yields the instance.

    >>> family = pfs.getByName('x86')
    >>> family.name
    u'x86'
    >>> family.title
    u'Intel 386 compatible chips'
    >>> family.description
    u'Bring back the 8086!'

It is also possible to get the processor family for a given processor.

    >>> family = pfs.getByProcessorName('386')
    >>> family.name
    u'x86'
    >>> family.title
    u'Intel 386 compatible chips'
    >>> family.description
    u'Bring back the 8086!'

In case where the user specifies a non-existent processor name the return
value will be None.

    >>> print pfs.getByProcessorName('wintel')
    None
