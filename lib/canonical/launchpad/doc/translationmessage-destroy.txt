== destroySelf ==

(Note: this test runs as rosettaadmin to obtain the necessary
privileges)

With this method, we allow to remove a submission, it comes from SQLObject,
but we test it here to be sure it appears in our public interface.

We will need extra permissions to use this method.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.translationmessage import (
    ...     TranslationMessage)

Select an existing ITranslationMessage and try to remove it.

    >>> translationmessage = TranslationMessage.get(1)
    >>> translationmessage.destroySelf()

It should not exist now.

    >>> translationmessage = TranslationMessage.get(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SQLObjectNotFound:...
