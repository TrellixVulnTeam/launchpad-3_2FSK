= Deleting branches =

Branches that have no revisions or links to other Launchpad objects
can be deleted.  The main use for this is to allow users to delete
branches that have been created in error.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
    >>> browser.getLink("Register a branch").click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Project').value = 'firefox'
    >>> browser.getControl('Branch URL').value = 'http://foo.bar.com/oops'
    >>> browser.getControl('Name').value = 'to-delete'
    >>> browser.getControl('Register Branch').click()
    >>> browser.title
    '...~name12/firefox/to-delete... branch in Launchpad'

The newly created branch has an action 'Delete branch'.

    >>> delete_link = browser.getLink('Delete branch')
    >>> print delete_link.url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/firefox/to-delete/+delete

When the user clicks on the link, they are informed what will happen if they
delete the branch.

    >>> delete_link.click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
    Last modified ...
    lp://dev/~name12/firefox/to-delete
    ...
    Delete branch
    Branch deletion is permanent.
    or Cancel

Once the branch has been deleted, the user is taken back to the code
listing for deleted branch's product, and a message is shown saying that
the branch has been deleted.

    >>> browser.getControl('Delete').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    Branch ~name12/firefox/to-delete deleted...

If the branch is junk, then the user is taken back to the code listing for
the deleted branch's owner.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
    >>> browser.getLink("Register a branch").click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Hosted').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Name').value = 'to-delete'
    >>> browser.getControl('Register Branch').click()
    >>> browser.getLink('Delete branch').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Delete').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    Branch ~name12/+junk/to-delete deleted...

Branches that are stacked upon cannot be deleted.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> stacked_upon = factory.makeAnyBranch()
    >>> stacked = factory.makeAnyBranch(stacked_on=stacked_upon)
    >>> branch_location = canonical_url(stacked_upon)
    >>> logout()

Even if you are an admin.

    >>> admin_browser.open(branch_location)
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Delete branch').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents))
