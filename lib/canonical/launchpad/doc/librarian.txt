Librarian Access
================

High Level
----------

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILibraryFileAliasSet
>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> data = 'This is some data'

We can create LibraryFileAliases using the ILibraryFileAliasSet utility.
This name is a mouthful, but is consistant with the rest of our naming.

>>> lfas = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)
>>> alias = lfas.create('text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain')
>>> alias.mimetype
u'text/plain'
>>> alias.filename
u'text.txt'

We can retrieve the LibraryFileAlias we just created using its ID.

>>> org_alias_id = alias.id
>>> alias = lfas[org_alias_id]
>>> alias.id == org_alias_id
True

We can get its URL too

>>> import re
>>> re.search(
...     r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/\d+/text.txt$', alias.url
...     ) is not None
True

However, we can't access its contents until we have committed

>>> alias.open()
Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
LookupError: ...

Once we commit the transaction, LibraryFileAliases can be accessed like
files.

>>> import transaction
>>> transaction.commit()

>>> alias.open()
>>> alias.read()
'This is some data'
>>> alias.close()

We can also read it in chunks.

>>> alias.open()
>>> alias.read(2)
'Th'
>>> alias.read(6)
'is is '
>>> alias.read()
'some data'
>>> alias.close()

If you don't want to read the file in chunks you can neglect to call
open() and close().

>>> alias.read()
'This is some data'

Low Level
---------

We can also use the ILibrarianClient Utility directly to store and access
files in the Librarian.

>>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient
>>> client = getUtility(ILibrarianClient)
>>> aid = client.addFile('text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain')
>>> transaction.commit()
>>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
>>> f.read()
'This is some data'
>>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
>>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/\d+/text.txt$', url) is not None
True

At this level we can also reverse the transactional semantics by using the
remoteAddFile instead of the addFile method. In this case, the database
rows are added by the Librarian, which means that the file is downloadable
immediately and will exist even if the client transaction rolls back.
However, the records in the database will not be visible to the client
until it begins a new transaction.

>>> url = client.remoteAddFile(
...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain'
...     )
>>> print url
http://localhost:58000/.../.../text.txt
>>> from urllib2 import urlopen
>>> urlopen(url).read()
'This is some data'

If we abort the transaction, it is still in there

>>> transaction.abort()
>>> urlopen(url).read()
'This is some data'

Buildd mechanism
----------------

>>> from canonical.config import config
>>> temp_url = config.librarian.buildd_download_url
>>> config.librarian.buildd_download_url = "http://NOT.VALID.COM/"

The build daemon machines operate in a restricted network. Because of
this they require a different download URL to that which gets
presented to the outside world. We thus need to check that when we
pass is_buildd=True to the URL retrieval part of the librarian, we get
back that which is configured as a buildd download url. We do this as
a separate configuration option because the buildd master sometimes
downloads files itself and that would require the standard
download_url.

>>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid, is_buildd=True)
>>> re.search(r'^http://NOT\.VALID\.COM/\d+/\d+/text.txt$', url) is not None
True

We also confirm that when not asking for a buildd URL, the configured
buildd_download_url does not interfere with the normal URL generation.

>>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
>>> re.search(r'^http://NOT\.VALID\.COM/\d+/\d+/text.txt$', url) is not None
False

>>> config.librarian.buildd_download_url = temp_url

Odds and Sods
-------------

An UploadFailed will be raised if you try to create a file with no content

>>> client.addFile('test.txt', 0, StringIO('hello'), 'text/plain')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
UploadFailed: No data

An AssertionError will be raised if the number of bytes that could be read
from the file don't match the declared size.

>>> client.addFile('test.txt', 42, StringIO(''), 'text/plain')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
AssertionError: size is 42, but 0 were read from the file

Filenames with spaces in them work.

>>> aid = client.addFile('hot dog', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain')
>>> transaction.commit()
>>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
>>> f.read()
'This is some data'
>>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
>>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/\d+/hot%20dog$', url) is not None
True

Unicode file names work.  Note that the filename in the resulting URL
is encoded as UTF-8.

>>> aid = client.addFile(u'Yow\N{INTERROBANG}', len(data), StringIO(data),
...                      'text/plain')
>>> transaction.commit()
>>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
>>> f.read()
'This is some data'
>>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
>>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/\d+/Yow%E2%80%BD$', url) is not None
True
