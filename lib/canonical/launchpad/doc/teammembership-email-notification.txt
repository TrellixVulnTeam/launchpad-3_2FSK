= Mail notifications for membership changes =

Whenever a membership status is changed, we should notify the team admins and
the member whose membership changed. There's a few cases where we might want
to notify only the team admins, but in most of the cases we'll be sending two
similar (but not identical) notifications: one for all team admins and another
for the member.

    >>> def by_to_addrs(a, b):
    ...     return cmp(a[1], b[1])

    >>> def setStatus(membership, status, reviewer=None, comment=None):
    ...     """Set the status of the given membership.
    ...
    ...     Also sets the reviewer and comment, calling flush_database_updates
    ...     and transaction.commit after, to ensure the changes are flushed to
    ...     the database.
    ...     """
    ...     membership.setStatus(
    ...         status, reviewer=reviewer, reviewercomment=comment)
    ...     flush_database_updates()
    ...     transaction.commit()

    >>> import email
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> def pop_notifications():
    ...     stub.test_emails.sort(by_to_addrs)
    ...     notifications = [
    ...         email.message_from_string(raw_message)
    ...         for fromaddr, toaddrs, raw_message in stub.test_emails]
    ...     stub.test_emails = []
    ...     return notifications

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IPersonSet, ITeamMembershipSet)

    >>> sabdfl = personset.getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> sampleperson = personset.getByName('name12')
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')

Now Robert Collins proposes himself as a member of the Ubuntu Team. This
generates a notification email only to Ubuntu Team administrators.

    >>> lifeless = personset.getByName('lifeless')
    >>> lifeless.join(ubuntu_team)
    >>> membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(lifeless, ubuntu_team)

    Hello
    <BLANKLINE>
    Robert Collins (lifeless) wants to be a member of Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-

    approved.  You can approve, decline or leave it as proposed by following
    the link below.

Declining a proposed member should generate notifications for both the member
and team admins.

== Adding new members ==

When a person is added as a member of a team by one of that team's
administrators, an email is sent to all team administrators and to the new
member.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> marilize = personset.getByName('marilize')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(marilize, reviewer=cprov)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    2
    >>> admins_notification, member_notification = pop_notifications()

    >>> member_notification['To']
    'marilize@hbd.com'
    >>> print member_notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,

    Celso Providelo (cprov) added you as a member of Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-

    >>> print admins_notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,
    <BLANKLINE>
    Marilize Coetzee (marilize) has been added as a member of Ubuntu Team
    (ubuntu-team) by Celso Providelo (cprov). Follow the link below for more
    details.

By default, if the newly added member is actually a team, we'll only send
an invitation to the team's admins, telling them that the membership will
only be activated if they accept the invitation.

    >>> mirror_admins = personset.getByName('ubuntu-mirror-admins')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import contactEmailAddresses
    >>> mirror_admins.getTeamAdminsEmailAddresses()
    ['mark@hbd.com']
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(mirror_admins, reviewer=cprov)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1
    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()
    >>> print notification['To']
    mark@hbd.com
    >>> print notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,
    <BLANKLINE>
    Celso Providelo (cprov) has invited Mirror Administrators (ubuntu-
    mirror-admins) (which you are an administrator of) to join Ubuntu Team
    (ubuntu-team).
    <BLANKLINE>
    You can accept or decline this invitation on the following page:
    <BLANKLINE>
        http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-mirror-admins/+invitation/ubuntu-team
    <BLANKLINE>
    Regards,
    The Launchpad team
    
If one of the admins accept the invitation, then a notification is sent to the
team which just became a member and to the admins of the hosting team.

    >>> mirror_admins.acceptInvitationToBeMemberOf(ubuntu_team)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Similarly, a notification is sent if the invitation is declined.

    >>> landscape = personset.getByName('landscape-developers')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(landscape, reviewer=cprov)

    # Reset stub.test_emails as we don't care about the notification triggered
    # by the addMember() call.
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> landscape.declineInvitationToBeMemberOf(ubuntu_team)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> len(stub.test_emails)

    >>> admins_notification, member_notification = pop_notifications()
    >>> print admins_notification['To']
    colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com, foo.bar@canonical.com,

It's also possible to forcibly add a team as a member of another one, by
passing force_team_add=True to the addMember() method.

    >>> launchpad = personset.getByName('launchpad')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(launchpad, reviewer=cprov, force_team_add=True)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> transaction.commit()

== Membership expiration warnings ==

When we get close to the expiration date of a given membership, an expiration
warning is sent to the member, so that he can contact the team's
administrators in case he wants to retain that membership. This is done by
the flag-expired-memberships cronscript, which uses
ITeamMembership.sendExpirationWarningEmail to do its job.

    >>> sabdfl_on_ubuntu_team = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     sabdfl, ubuntu_team)
    >>> sabdfl_on_ubuntu_team.sendExpirationWarningEmail()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()
    >>> notification['To']
    'Mark Shuttleworth <mark@hbd.com>'
    >>> notification['Subject']

== Membership expiration notification ==

For teams with a renewal policy other than AUTOMATIC, if a membership is not
renewed before its expiration date it'll be flagged as expired and a
notification is sent to the team admins and to the member whose membership
expired. If the renewal policy is AUTOMATIC, though, the memberships that
should expire will retain their status and have their dateexpires update. A
notification is also sent to the member and to team admins when a membership
is automatically renewed.

    >>> import pytz
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy
    >>> utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> lp_admins = personset.getByName('admins')
    >>> lp_admins.renewal_policy == TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy.NONE
    True
    >>> sabdfl_on_admins = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(sabdfl, lp_admins)
    >>> sabdfl_on_admins.dateexpires = utc_now

    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ubuntu_team.renewal_policy = TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy.AUTOMATIC
    >>> ubuntu_team.defaultrenewalperiod = 365
    >>> jdub = personset.getByName('jdub')
    >>> jdub_on_ubuntu_team = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     jdub, ubuntu_team)
    >>> jdub_on_ubuntu_team.dateexpires = utc_now
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> membershipset.handleMembershipsExpiringToday(
    ...     reviewer=getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).team_membership_janitor)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    6

The expiration/auto-renewal notifications are sent to each person
individually rather than sending a single email to everybody, so we'll
just show the recipients and the different messages we may send.

    >>> distinct_messages = {}
    >>> for message in pop_notifications():
    ...     recipients = set(
    ...         recipient.strip() for recipient in message['To'].split(','))
    ...     body = message.get_payload()
    ...     if body not in distinct_messages:
    ...         distinct_messages[body] = recipients
    ...     else:
    ...         existing_recipients = distinct_messages[body]
    ...         distinct_messages[body] = existing_recipients.union(recipients)

    >>> for message in sorted(distinct_messages):
    ...     print 'To:', sorted(distinct_messages[message])
    ...     print message #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    ...     print "-"*40

== Some special cases ==

When creating a new team, the owner has his membership's status changed from
approved to admin, but he won't get a notification of that.

    >>> team = personset.newTeam(sabdfl, 'testteam', 'Test')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

    # Other tests expect an empty stub.test_emails, but if this one above
    # fails, I don't want a non-empty stub.test_emails to cause the tests
    # below to fail too.
    >>> stub.test_emails = []

If cprov is made an administrator of ubuntu_team, he'll only get one email
notification.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> cprov_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(cprov, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(
    ...     cprov_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.ADMIN, reviewer=sabdfl)
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2
    >>> member_notification, admins_notification = pop_notifications()
    >>> print admins_notification['To']
    colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com, foo.bar@canonical.com,
    jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com, mark@hbd.com
    >>> member_notification['To']
    'celso.providelo@canonical.com'

If a team admin changes his own membership, the notification sent will clearly
say that the change was performed by the user himself, and it will only be
sent to the team administrators.

    >>> jdub = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jdub')
    >>> jdub_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(jdub, ubuntu_team)

Deactivating the membership of a team also generates notifications for the
team which had the membership deactivated and to the administrators of the
hosting team. Note that the notification sent to the team whose membership
was deactivated will not talk about "your membership" as it wouldn't make
sense to the members of the team reading it.

    ...     mirror_admins, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(mirror_admins_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED,

    >>> admins_notification['To']
