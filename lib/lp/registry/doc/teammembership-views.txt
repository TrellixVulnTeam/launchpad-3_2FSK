Team membership views
=====================

When a team is invited to join another team, the TeamInvitationsView controls
the ~team/+invitations page.

    >>> team = factory.makeTeam(displayname='Bassists', name='bassists')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(team, '+invitations')
    >>> print view.label
    Invitations for Bassists
