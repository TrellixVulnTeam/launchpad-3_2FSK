The XMLRPC API for registering branches is handled by BranchAPI.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.xmlrpc import BranchAPI
    >>> branch_api = BranchAPI(None, None)

register_branch(branch_url, branch_name, branch_title,
                branch_description, author_email, product_name)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Let's register a branch using register_branch(). First we make sure that
there is no branch with the URL we are going to register.

XXX: Branch URLs should be unique. David has a patch that will make
     branch URLs unique, and add some other constraints.
     -- Bjorn Tillenius, 2006-03-22

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Branch
    >>> branch_url = 'http://foo.com/branch'
    >>> Branch.selectBy(url=branch_url).count()
    0

The only thing that we have to supply is the branch url, and the author
of the branch. The rest is optional, so we pass '' for the rest of the
parameters. We use the currently authenticated user as the owner of the
branch, so let's log in as Foo Bar.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> branch_api.register_branch(
    ...      'http://foo.com/branch', '', '', '', 'test@canonical.com', '')
    u'Successfully registered the branch.'

Now we can see that a branch got registered:

    >>> Branch.selectBy(url=branch_url).count()
    1
    >>> new_branch = Branch.selectOneBy(url=branch_url)

The author got set to Sample Person, and the author to Foo Bar:

    >>> print new_branch.author.displayname
    Sample Person
    >>> print new_branch.owner.displayname
    Foo Bar

The name and title got set to the last component of the URL:

    >>> print new_branch.name
    branch
    >>> print new_branch.title
    branch

Since we didn't specify product and description, they are None:

    >>> new_branch.product is None
    True
    >>> new_branch.summary is None
    True


Let's register a branch specifying the name, description and product as
well:

    >>> branch_url = 'http://foo.com/other_branch'
    >>> branch_api.register_branch(
    ...      branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    u'Successfully registered the branch.'
    >>> Branch.selectBy(url=branch_url).count()
    1

    >>> new_branch = Branch.selectOneBy(url=branch_url)
    >>> print new_branch.owner.displayname
    Foo Bar
    >>> print new_branch.author.displayname
    Sample Person

    >>> print new_branch.name
    branch_name
    >>> print new_branch.title
    branch_name
    >>> print new_branch.product.displayname
    Evolution

If we give a product name that doesn't exist, we get an error:

    >>> branch_api.register_branch(
    ...      branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'non-existing')
    <Fault 10: 'No such product: non-existing.'>

If we get an email address which isn't registered in Launchpad:

    >>> branch_api.register_branch(
    ...      branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'non-existing@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    <Fault 20: 'No such email is registered in Launchpad:
     non-existing@canonical.com.'>

We don't support anonymous branch registrations:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> branch_api.register_branch(
    ...      branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    <Fault 99: 'Anonymous registration of branches is not supported.'>
