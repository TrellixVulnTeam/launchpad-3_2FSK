= Archive Permissions =

The ArchivePermission table gives us a way of looking up permissions for
operations in the archive context.  The IArchivePermission utility adds
an easy way of accessing the data through convenient helpers.

Two main operations are supported: upload and queue administration.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     ArchivePermissionType, IArchivePermission, IArchivePermissionSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ArchivePermission

    >>> permission_set = getUtility(IArchivePermissionSet)

The ArchivePermission context class implements the IArchivePermission
interface.

    >>> random_permission = ArchivePermission.get(1)
    >>> verifyObject(IArchivePermission, random_permission)
    True

It's possible to make a direct permission enquiry using the method
'checkAuthenticated'.  The "Ubuntu Team" has a few permissions set in
the sample data that we can check.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IComponentSet, IDistributionSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("ubuntu-team")
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> main_component = getUtility(IComponentSet)['main']

We can now find out if "Ubuntu Team" has permission to upload to the
main component.

    >>> main_permissions = permission_set.checkAuthenticated(
    ...     ubuntu_team, ubuntu.main_archive, ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD,
    ...     main_component)
    >>> main_permissions.count()
    1

    >>> [main_permission] = main_permissions

The fact that an ArchivePermission object is returned means that the
Ubuntu Team is indeed permissioned to upload to the main archive.  It
has a number of useful properties that can be checked:

    >>> print main_permission.date_created
    2006-10-16...

    >>> print main_permission.archive.title
    Primary Archive for Ubuntu Linux

    >>> main_permission.permission
    <DBItem ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD, (1) Archive Upload Rights>

    >>> print main_permission.person.name
    ubuntu-team

    >>> print main_permission.component_name
    main

    >>> print main_permission.source_package_name
    None

The checkAuthenticated() call is also able to check someone's
permission on a SourcePackageName, which gives a smaller radius of
permission than allowing access to the whole component.  Just pass
a SourcePacakgeName as the "item" parameter:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISourcePackageNameSet
    >>> alsa_utils = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)['alsa-utils']
    >>> alsa_permissions = permission_set.checkAuthenticated(
    ...     ubuntu_team, ubuntu.main_archive, ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD,
    ...     alsa_utils)

Ubuntu Team does not have permission to upload to alsa-utils,
specifically (which is moot anyway because they have access to the
component, but this demonstrates package-level permissioning):

    >>> alsa_permissions.count()
    0

When passing a person to checkAuthenticated() who is a member of a team
that has permission, the matching ArchivePermission record(s) for the
team are returned.  This allows team-level permissions to be set.

    >>> sabdfl = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("sabdfl")
    >>> sabdfl.inTeam(ubuntu_team)
    True

    >>> all_main_permissions = permission_set.uploadersForComponent(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, main_component)
    >>> [permission.person.name for permission in all_main_permissions]
    [u'ubuntu-team']

    >>> sabdfl_permissions = permission_set.checkAuthenticated(
    ...     sabdfl, ubuntu.main_archive, ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD,
    ...     main_component)
    >>> sabdfl_permissions.count()
    1

checkAuthenticated() does not know about any other item types, and
passing a type that it does not know about results in a TypeError:

    >>> permission_set.checkAuthenticated(
    ...     ubuntu_team, ubuntu.main_archive, ArchivePermissionType.UPLOAD,
    ...     ubuntu)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 'item' is not an IComponent or an ISourcePackageName

IArchivePermissionSet also has some helpers to make it very easy to
check permissions.

permissionsForUser() returns all the permission records for the supplied user:

    >>> permissions = permission_set.permissionsForUser(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive,  ubuntu_team)
    >>> permissions.count()
    8

uploadersForComponent() returns ArchivePermission records where a person
or team has permission to upload to the supplied component:

    >>> import operator
    >>> uploaders = permission_set.uploadersForComponent(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, main_component)
    >>> for uploader in sorted(uploaders, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print uploader.person.name
    ubuntu-team

If the component argument is not passed, it will return
ArchivePermission records for all matching components:

    >>> uploaders = permission_set.uploadersForComponent(ubuntu.main_archive)
    >>> for uploader in sorted(uploaders, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print uploader.person.name, uploader.component.name
    ubuntu-team universe
    ubuntu-team restricted
    ubuntu-team main

componentsForUploader() returns ArchivePermission records for all the
components that the supplied user has permission to upload to.

    >>> permissions = permission_set.componentsForUploader(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, sabdfl)
    >>> for permission in sorted(permissions, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print permission.component.name
    universe
    restricted
    main

uploadersForPackage() returns the ArchivePermission records where a person
or team has permission to upload to the supplied source package name:

    >>> uploaders = permission_set.uploadersForPackage(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, alsa_utils)
    >>> uploaders.count()
    0

You can also pass a string package name instead of an ISourcePackageName:

    >>> uploaders = permission_set.uploadersForPackage(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, "alsa-utils")
    >>> uploaders.count()
    0

Passing a non-existent package name will cause a NotFoundError
to be thrown.

    >>> uploaders = permission_set.uploadersForPackage(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, "fakepackage")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFoundError: 'fakepackage'

Similarly, packagesForUploaders() returns the ArchivePermission records where
the supplied user has permission to upload to packages.

    >>> carlos = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("carlos")
    >>> packages = permission_set.packagesForUploader(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, carlos)
    >>> for permission in sorted(packages, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print permission.sourcepackagename.name
    mozilla-firefox

queueAdminsForComponent() returns the ArchivePermission records where a
person or team has permission to administer an archive's package
queues in that component.

    >>> archive_admins = permission_set.queueAdminsForComponent(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, main_component)
    >>> for archive_admin in sorted(
    ...     archive_admins, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print archive_admin.person.name
    ubuntu-team
    name12

componentsForQueueAdmin() returns the ArchivePermission records for all
the components that the supplied user has permission to administer in
the distroseries queue.

    >>> name12 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("name12")
    >>> permissions = permission_set.componentsForQueueAdmin(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, name12)
    >>> for permission in sorted(permissions, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print permission.component.name
    main
    restricted
    universe
    multiverse

    >>> no_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("no-team-memberships")
    >>> permissions = permission_set.componentsForQueueAdmin(
    ...     ubuntu.main_archive, no_team)
    >>> for permission in sorted(permissions, key=operator.attrgetter("id")):
    ...     print permission.component.name
    universe
    multiverse
