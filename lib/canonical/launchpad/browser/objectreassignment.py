    used in IObjectReassignment). If any object has special needs, it'll be
    necessary to subclass ObjectReassignmentView and redefine the schema
    and/or ownerOrMaintainerAttr attributes.

    Subclasses can also specify a callback to be called after the reassignment
    takes place. This callback must accept three arguments (in this order):
    the object whose owner is going to be changed, the old owner and the new
    owner.

    Also, if the object for which you're using this view doesn't have a
    displayname or name attribute, you'll have to subclass it and define the
    contextName property in your subclass.
