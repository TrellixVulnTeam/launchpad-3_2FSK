Testing the Package Death Row
=============================

  >>> import datetime
  >>> import pytz
  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import PackagePublishingStatus

We're working inside Ubuntu:

  >>> distro = Distribution.selectOneBy(name="ubuntu")

Temporary directories to be used in tests:

  >>> import os
  >>> pool_path = '/tmp/pool'
  >>> os.makedirs(pool_path)
  >>> temp_path = '/tmp/temp'
  >>> os.makedirs(temp_path)


Nothing to do
=============

The no-operation use case:

  >>> dp = DiskPool(pool_path, temp_path, MockLogger())
  >>> dr = DeathRow(distro.main_archive, dp, MockLogger())
  >>> dr.reap(dry_run=True)
  DEBUG: 0 Sources
  DEBUG: 0 Binaries
  INFO: Removing 0 files marked for reaping
  INFO: Total bytes freed: 0
  DEBUG: Marking 0 condemned packages as removed.

Package Removal (dry-run)
=========================

And, if we mark some packages to be pending removal. Source publication
15 refers to alsa-utils_1.0.9a-4.dsc:

  >>> this_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
  >>> old_date = datetime.datetime(year=this_year - 2, month=1, day=1,
  ...                              tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))
  >>> future_date = datetime.datetime(year=this_year + 2, month=1, day=1,
  ...                                 tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))

  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(15)
  >>> print pub.dateremoved
  None
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.DELETED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date

Source publication 12 includes alsa-utils_1.0.9a-4ubuntu1.dsc:

  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(12)
  >>> print pub.distroseries.name
  hoary
  >>> print pub.dateremoved
  None
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date

But so does source publication 20, which we'll set to pending removal
but with a scheduled deletion date in the future. Because not all of the
references to the file are ready to be removed, the file will not be
deleted yet.

  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(20)
  >>> print pub.distroseries.name
  warty
  >>> print [f.libraryfile.filename
  ...        for f in pub.sourcepackagerelease.files]
  [u'alsa-utils_1.0.9a-4ubuntu1.dsc']
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = future_date

Knock off some binaries as well:

  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(17)
  >>> print pub.dateremoved
  None
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date

  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(19)
  >>> print pub.dateremoved
  None
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.DELETED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date

As above, both 19 and 21 binary publication refer to the same pmount
binaries, and since 21 is not to be removed, 19 is supposed to be left
alone too:

  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(21)
  >>> print [f.libraryfile.filename
  ...        for f in pub.binarypackagerelease.files]
  [u'pmount_1.9-1_all.deb']

  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(19)
  >>> print [f.libraryfile.filename
  ...        for f in pub.binarypackagerelease.files]
  [u'pmount_1.9-1_all.deb']


Flush our these updates and kick the DeathRow processor again.

  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> dp = DiskPool(pool_path, temp_path, MockLogger())
  >>> dr = DeathRow(distro.main_archive, dp, MockLogger())
  >>> dr.reap(dry_run=True)
  DEBUG: 2 Sources
  DEBUG: 2 Binaries
  INFO: Removing 2 files marked for reaping

  DEBUG: File to remove main alsa-utils/alsa-utils_1.0.9a-4.dsc is not in pool, skipping

  DEBUG: Marking 2 condemned packages as removed.

Note that while we are in dry run mode, the database queries are
actually executed; the process-death-row script however does not commit
the transaction when that flag is set.

Look at the results of our actions. Two packages removed (one source
and one binary) and the date removed properly set up:

  >>> source_pub = SSPPH.get(15)
  >>> source_pub.status.name
  'DELETED'
  >>> source_pub.dateremoved
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'

  >>> binary_pub = SBPPH.get(17)
  >>> binary_pub.status.name
  'SUPERSEDED'
  >>> binary_pub.dateremoved
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'

Source publication 20 (has a future 'scheduled deletion date') and
binary publication 19 (file hold by another active publication), of
course are left alone:

  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(20)
  >>> pub.dateremoved is None
  True

  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(19)
  >>> pub.dateremoved is None
  True


Package Removal (simulated real run)
====================================

Test that bytes freed computing is handled correctly:

  >>> def removeFileReturningSize(cn, sn, fn):
  ...    print "DEBUG: (Not really!) removing %s %s/%s" % (cn, sn, fn)
  ...    return 5
  >>> dr._removeFile = removeFileReturningSize
  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(2)
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.DELETED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date
  >>> pub = SBPPH.get(24)
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> dr.reap()
  DEBUG: 2 Sources
  DEBUG: 2 Binaries
  INFO: Removing 2 files marked for reaping

  DEBUG: (Not really!) removing main evolution/evolution-1.0.tar.gz
  INFO: Total bytes freed: 10

Test that random exceptions are handled correctly:

  >>> def removeFileRaisingOtherException(cn, sn, fn):
  ...    print "DEBUG: (Not really!) removing %s %s/%s" % (cn, sn, fn)
  ...    raise TypeError
  >>> dr._removeFile = removeFileRaisingOtherException
  >>> pub = SSPPH.get(10)
  >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
  >>> pub.scheduleddeletiondate = old_date

Remove temporary diretories used for tests:

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(pool_path)
  >>> shutil.rmtree(temp_path)
