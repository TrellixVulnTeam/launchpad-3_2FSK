    <h1>Why do I need a "Subscription name"?</h1>

    <p>
      You may have more than one structural subscription per project, each
      with different criteria.  You may provide a name in order to identify
      them in the future in order to edit or delete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also the subscription name will be included in all email that is sent
      due to this subscription in
      a <code>X-Launchpad-Subscription-Description</code> header.  You can
      filter your incoming email based on that header.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, please provide a short, descriptive name to help you remember this
      subscription.
