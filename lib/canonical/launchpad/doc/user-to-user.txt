= Direct user-to-user email =

Launchpad users can send emails to each other directly, through the Launchpad
web interface.  Launchpad tracks these both for informational purposes and to
limit or throttle the number of messages that any one person can send.  The
throttling happens over a configurable interval.

Anne and Bart are Launchpad users.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> anne = factory.makePerson('anne@example.com', 'anne')
    >>> bart = factory.makePerson('bart@example.com', 'bart')

Anne wants to contact Bart to ask him a question about his Launchpad project,
but Bart's email addresses are hidden.  Anne decides to use Launchpad's direct
user-to-user contact form to send Bart a message.  Is she allowed to?

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.message import IThrottle
    >>> throttle = getUtility(IThrottle)
    >>> throttle.allow(anne)
    True

Launchpad records the event when Anne sends the message to Bart.

    >>> from email import message_from_string
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.message import UserToUserEmail

    >>> contact = UserToUserEmail(message_from_string("""\
    ... From: anne@example.com
    ... To: bart@example.com
    ... Date: Thu, 25 Sep 2008 15:29:38 +0100
    ... Message-ID: <aardvark>
    ... Subject: Project Bumstead
    ...
    ... This looks just like project Blonde.  Please contact me.
    ... """))

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

Anne really likes Bart's project, so she sends him another message.

    # Use an explicit cutoff date instead of yesterday.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.message import (
    ...     utcdatetime_from_field)
    >>> after = utcdatetime_from_field('Thu, 25 Sep 2008 15:29:38 +0100')

    >>> throttle.allow(anne, after)
    True

    >>> contact = UserToUserEmail(message_from_string("""\
    ... From: anne@example.com
    ... To: bart@example.com
    ... Date: Thu, 25 Sep 2008 15:30:38 +0100
    ... Message-ID: <badger>
    ... Subject: Re: Project Bumstead
    ...
    ... No really, this is so cool!
    ... """))
    >>> transaction.commit()

Anne also likes Cris's project, and wants to contact her directly.

    >>> throttle.allow(anne, after)
    True

    >>> cris = factory.makePerson('cris@example.com', 'cris')
    >>> contact = UserToUserEmail(message_from_string("""\
    ... From: anne@example.com
    ... To: cris@example.com
    ... Date: Thu, 25 Sep 2008 15:31:38 +0100
    ... Message-ID: <cougar>
    ... Subject: Project Dagwood
    ...
    ... Not as cool as Bumstead, but still neat.
    ... """))
    >>> transaction.commit()

Anne is no longer allowed to contact any Launchpad users directly, at least
until tomorrow.

    >>> throttle.allow(anne, after)
    False
