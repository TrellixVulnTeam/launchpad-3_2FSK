Ticket Tracking System
======================

Launchpad includes a tech support ticket tracker.

We should be able to get a ticket for a distribution, or a source package,
or a product, by ticket number. If there is no such ticket, we should get a
None

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ... IDistributionSet, IProductSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import SourcePackage
    >>> distroset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
    >>> spnset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> p = productset.get(1)
    >>> print p.getTicket(34243)
    None
    >>> d = distroset.get(1)
    >>> print d.getTicket(3242343)
    None
    >>> s = spnset.get(1)
    >>> sp = SourcePackage(sourcepackagename=s, distribution=d)
    >>> print sp.getTicket(3234353453)
    None
