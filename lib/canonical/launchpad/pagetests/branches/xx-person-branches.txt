= Person Views of Branch Lists =

There are several views of the branches related to a person.

Branch lists for people also include branches that are owned by
teams that the person is participating in.

== Related Branches ==

First, check that the condensed branch listing page works:

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...Sample Person...
  ...Bazaar branches...

If a person does not have any related branches, we print an informative
message.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~kinnison')
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There may be branches related to Daniel Silverstone but none 
  of them match the current filter criteria for this page. Try
  filtering on "Any Status".

OK, lets follow the advice.

  >>> browser.getControl(name='field.lifecycle').displayValue = ['Any Status']
  >>> browser.getControl('Filter').click()
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There are no branches related to Daniel Silverstone in Launchpad today.
  You can use Launchpad as a registry for Bazaar branches, and encourage
  broader community participation in your project using
  distributed version control.

== Default view for a person on code root site ==

The default view for a person on the code root site is the 
normal branch listing view for that person.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~kinnison')
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There may be branches related to Daniel Silverstone but none 
  of them match the current filter criteria for this page. Try
  filtering on "Any Status".


== Authored Branches ==

There is a link in the branch context menu for person which points to
the authored branches page.

   >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
   >>> browser.getLink('Show authored branches').click()
   >>> print browser.title
