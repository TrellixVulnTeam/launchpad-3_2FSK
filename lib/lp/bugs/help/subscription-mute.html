    <h1>What happens when I "mute" a bug?</h1>

    <p>
      Muting a bug tells Launchpad to stop sending you all email about 
      that bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is most useful when you've subscribed to the bugs for an entire
      milestone, series, project or distribution. If there's one bug that
      doesn't interest you, you can mute it without affecting your overall 
      subscription.
    </p>
    <h2>Unmuting</h2>
    <p>
      When "unmuting" a bug you can choose what sorts of thing you want to
      hear about, just like when you make a new subscription.
    </p>
    <h2>Muting bugs that come from a team subscription</h2>
    <p>
      If you are subscribed via a team, but the team delivers its bug mail
      via a mailing list or some other team email address, you can't mute 
      bugs you hear about thanks to that subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's because in that case Launchpad delivers each email just once: 
      to the team's mailing list or other specified email address. So, it 
      can't filter out email intended specifically for you because it 
      doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, you could try filtering the bug mail you receive via the 
      team's mailing list and then subscribing to the project's bugs 
      yourself. That will let you mute whichever bugs you like.
