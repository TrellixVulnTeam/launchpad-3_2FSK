== searchTickets() ==

IPerson defines a searchTickets() method which can be used to
select all or a subset of the support requests in which the person is
involved. This includes tickets which the person created, is assigned
to, is subscribed to, commented on, or answered. Various subsets can
be selected by using the following criteria status, search_text and
participation type.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> foo_bar = personset.getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')

=== search_text ===

The search_text parameter will limit the tickets to those matching
the query using the regular full text algorithm.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(search_text='firefox'):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    Firefox loses focus and gets stuck              Open

=== sort ===

When using the search_text criteria, the default is to sort the results
by relevancy. One can use the sort parameter to change that. It takes
one of the constant defined in the TicketSort enumeration.

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketSort
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         search_text='firefox', sort=TicketSort.OLDEST_FIRST):
    ...     print ticket.id, ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    4 Firefox loses focus and gets stuck              Open

When no text search is done, the default sort order is
TicketSort.NEWEST_FIRST.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets():
    ...     print ticket.id, ticket.title, ticket.status.title

=== status ===

The last searches showed that by default, not all statuses are searched
for by default (they excluded expired and invalid tickets). The status
parameter can be used to control the list of statuses to select:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketStatus
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(status=TicketStatus.INVALID):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM   Invalid

The status parameter can also take a list of statuses.

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         status=[TicketStatus.SOLVED, TicketStatus.INVALID]):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title

=== participation ===

By default, any types of relationship to a ticket is considered by
searchTickets. This can customized through the participation parameter.
It takes one or a list of constants from the TicketParticipation enumeration.

To select only tickets on which the person commented, the
TicketParticipation.COMMENTER is used:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketParticipation
    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.COMMENTER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title

TicketParticipation.SUBSCRIBER will only select the tickets to which
the person is subscribed to:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.SUBSCRIBER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title

TicketParticipation.OWNER selects the tickets that the person created:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.OWNER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    Slow system

TicketParticipation.ANSWERER selects the tickets for which the person
was marked as the answerer:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.ANSWERER, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    mailto: problem in webpage
    Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM

TicketParticipation.ASSIGNEE selects that tickets which are assigned to
the person:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.ASSIGNEE, status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title

If a list of these constants is used, all of these participation types
will be selected:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         participation=[
    ...             TicketParticipation.OWNER, TicketParticipation.ANSWERER],
    ...         status=None):
    ...     print ticket.title
    mailto: problem in webpage

=== Combination ===

The returned sets of tickets is the intersection of the sets delimited
by each criteria:

    >>> for ticket in foo_bar.searchTickets(
    ...         search_text='firefox OR Java', status=TicketStatus.ANSWERED,
    ...         participation=TicketParticipation.COMMENTER):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.status.title
