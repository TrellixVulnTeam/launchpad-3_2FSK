BuildFarmJob
============

    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     IBuildFarmJob)
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.enums import BuildFarmJobType
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.model.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     BuildFarmJob, BuildFarmJobDerived)

BuildFarmJob provides a basic implementation of IBuildFarmJob.  The
specific build farm job classes will automatically delegate to
BuildFarmJob by inheriting BuildFarmJobDerived.

    >>> buildfarmjob = BuildFarmJob(BuildFarmJobType.PACKAGEBUILD)
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJob, buildfarmjob)
    True

The BuildFarmJob class provides many of the common attributes used by
different types of build farm jobs, as well as default implementations
for the common methods.  The BuildFarmJob class provides default
implementations for many build-related methods.

    >>> print buildfarmjob.getLogFileName()
    buildlog.txt

    >>> buildfarmjob.getName()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError

For more details, please refer to lp.buildmaster.tests.test_buildfarmjob.

This class also includes the getByJob() class method used to find the
instance of a specific build-farm job implementation associated with a
given Job instance which must be called in the context of a concrete
derived class. See lp.buildmaster.tests.test_buildqueue for examples.
