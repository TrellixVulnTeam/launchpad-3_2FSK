BuildFarmJob
============

    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     IBuildFarmJob)
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.enums import BuildFarmJobType
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.model.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     BuildFarmJob, BuildFarmJobDerived)

BuildFarmJob provides a basic implementation of IBuildFarmJob.  The
specific build farm job classes will automatically delegate to
BuildFarmJob by inheriting BuildFarmJobDerived.

    >>> buildfarmjob = BuildFarmJob(BuildFarmJobType.PACKAGEBUILD)
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJob, buildfarmjob)
    True
