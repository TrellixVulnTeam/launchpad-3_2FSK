    This report shows all the projects for which this person is registered as
    an answer contact. This may be because he, or a team he is a member of, is 
    set as an answer contact. A project may also be listed if a team that the
    person belongs to is a member of another team that is set as an answer
    contact.
  </p>
  <p>
    A person may choose the "Remove yourself" link to unset himself as an
    answer contact when he is logged in and viewing this page in his own
    profile.
