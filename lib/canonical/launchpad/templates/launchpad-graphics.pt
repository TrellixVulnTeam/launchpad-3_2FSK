<div metal:fill-slot="main">

  <p class="documentDescription">
    A summary of the icons and graphics used in Launchpad, what sizes they
    occur in, and what they mean.
  </p>

  <h2>Icon naming</h2>

  <p>
    We need a systematic and consistent way to name icons. At the moment, we
    just put whatever the name of the first icon we picked was straight into
    the templates. <i><b>Proposal:</b> we should use a name structure like
    "add_large", "add_small" and "add" to indicate the icons for "adding",
    with no reference to the file type (so, not "add.png") or size. Perhaps
    we should have "add_scalable" or "add_svg" to indicate scalable
    images.</i>
  </p>

  <h2>System icons</h2>

  <p>
    These icons are used throughout the system, in all applications.

  <h2>Application graphics</h2>

  <p>
    These are images that represent one of the Launchpad applications, for
    example the bug tracker (codename "Malone") or the translation system
    (code name "Rosetta"). The large version of these images will be used on
    the landing pages for those applications (bugs.launchpad.net or
    features.launchpad.net), and may also be used on the overall Launchpad
    home page (launchpad.net).

  <h3>Malone, the bug tracker</h3>

  <p>
    <img src="/@@/malone" align="left" />Malone is the bug tracking engine
    in Launchpad. It enables projects to track their bugs and also to
