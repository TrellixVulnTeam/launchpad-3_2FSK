We should have a page that lists all projects.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /projects/+all HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Projects registered in Launchpad...

And similarly, one for all products.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/+all HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,af;q=0.3
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Products registered in Launchpad...
