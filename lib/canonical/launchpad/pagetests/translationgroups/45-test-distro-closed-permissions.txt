So now Foo Bar is the Afrikaans translator for the PolyGlot translation
group, and they are the translation group for Ubuntu, which has Closed
translations. This means that Foo Bar should be able to translate any
strings in Ubuntu to Afrikaans. In other languages, Foo Bar should be
restricted only to seeing and contributing translations for strings which
are not already translated at all.

Let's see if Foo Bar can see the translated strings in Southern Sotho. We
expect that they will not have the widget to allow them to show the
translated strings:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/st/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
      <!-- Display settings. -->
  <BLANKLINE>
  <BLANKLINE>
  <BLANKLINE>
  <BLANKLINE>
          <!-- The translation form. -->
  ...

However, in Afrikaans, Foo Bar DOES have the ability to see the widget to
switch to editing previously-translated strings.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/af/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
