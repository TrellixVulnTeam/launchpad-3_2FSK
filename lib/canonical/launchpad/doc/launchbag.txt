The LaunchBag is a collection of all the 'stuff' we have traversed. It
contains the requests 'context' or environment, which can be used to
filter or otherwise specialize views or behavior.

>>> person = object()

>>> class Principal(object):
...     id = 23
...     def __conform__(self, protocol):
...         if protocol is IPerson:
...             return Person()

>>> class Participation(object):
...     principal = principal
...     interaction = None
