NewLineToSpaces Widget
======================

This custom widget is used to replace new line characters to spaces.

  >>> from canonical.widgets.bugtask import NewLineToSpacesWidget
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugTaskSearch

We pass a string with some new line characters to the widget

  >>> field = IBugTaskSearch['searchtext']
  >>> request = TestRequest(
  ...     form={'field.searchtext':'some text\rwith\nnew\r\nlines'})
  >>> widget = NewLineToSpacesWidget(field, request)

And check that the new lines were replaced by spaces.

  >>> widget.getInputValue()
  u'some text with new lines'
