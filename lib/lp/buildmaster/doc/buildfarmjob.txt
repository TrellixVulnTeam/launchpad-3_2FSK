= BuildFarmJob =

BuildFarmJob provides a basic implementation of IBuildFarmJob.  The
specific build farm job classes should inherit from it.

    >>> buildfarmjob = BuildFarmJob()
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJob, buildfarmjob) 

As a class, it also provides ISpecificBuildFarmJobClass so that
BuildQueue can find the instance of a specific build-farm job
implementation associated with a given Job instance.

    >>> verifyObject(ISpecificBuildFarmJobClass, BuildFarmJob)
