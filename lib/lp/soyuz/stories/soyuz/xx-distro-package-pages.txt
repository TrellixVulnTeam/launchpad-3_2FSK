= Distribution Package Peculiarities =

There are a number of pages for packages under the distribution
hierarchy. This test verifies some peculiar features in that hierarchy.


== $(distribution)/+source redirects home ==

Check that going to $distribution/+source redirects to $distribution.

  >>> browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source")
  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu'


== DistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease offer dgettable URLs ==

One useful tool for fetching source packages is dget, which pulls a DSC
file and then grabs its dependencies. In Launchpad, we model a virtual
directory under distro series source package release pages which
actually redirects individual entries to librarian URLs.

The commercial package lists three files:

  >>> browser.open(
  ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/breezy-autotest/+source/'
  ...     'commercialpackage/1.0-1')
  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'files'))
  commercialpackage_1.0.orig.tar.gz (179 bytes)
  commercialpackage_1.0-1.diff.gz (610 bytes)
  commercialpackage_1.0-1.dsc (567 bytes)

If you check out the URL for the DSC, you'll see it's in the +files
virtual directory:

  >>> file_link = browser.getLink("commercialpackage_1.0-1.dsc")
  >>> print file_link.url
  http://.../+files/commercialpackage_1.0-1.dsc

  >>> from urlparse import urlsplit
  >>> path = urlsplit(file_link.url)[2]

And if you go to fetch it, you'll see it's actually a librarian URL:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET %s HTTP/1.1
  ... """ % path)
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://.../68/commercialpackage_1.0-1.dsc
  ...
