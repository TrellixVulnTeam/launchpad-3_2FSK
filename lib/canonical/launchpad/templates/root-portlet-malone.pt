    <a i18n:attributes="title" title="Malone"
       href="malone" i18n:translate="">Malone</a> is a
    <strong>Web-based global bug tracker</strong>.
    It is designed to track bugs across the whole open source
    process: it understands that the same code is re-used upstream
    and in different distributions, and allows us to have a single
    bug number for any bug, and track where it has been fixed and
    where it is still a problem.
