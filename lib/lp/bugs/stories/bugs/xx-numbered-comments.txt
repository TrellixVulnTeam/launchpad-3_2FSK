= Comment numbering =

Bug respondents frequently refer to other comments by number,
eg. "applied patch in comment #34". This number is stable, and part of
the permalink URL. To help users find the relevant comments more
easily, the numbers are displayed in the comment header.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/jokosher/+bug/11')
    >>> comments = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     anon_browser.contents, 'boardComment')
    >>> for comment in comments:
    ...     number_node = comment.find(None, 'bug-comment-index')
    ...     person_node = comment.find(
    ...         lambda node: 'person' in node.get('class', ''))
    ...     comment_node = comment.find(None, 'bug-comment')
    ...     print "%s: %s\n  %s" % (
    ...         extract_text(number_node),
    ...         extract_text(person_node),
    ...         extract_text(comment_node)[:50])
