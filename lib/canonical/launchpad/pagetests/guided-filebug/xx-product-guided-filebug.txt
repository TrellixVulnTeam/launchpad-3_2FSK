Malone does its best to minimize duplicate bug reports. The +filebug
page for a product starts by asking the user to see if their bug has
already been reported.

The user fills in some keywords, and clicks a button to search existing
bugs.

    >>> user_browser.open("http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+filebug")

    >>> user_browser.getControl(name="field.title").value = "svg"
    >>> user_browser.getControl("Search for similar bugs").click()

The form is self-posting, so the user is still at +filebug. This makes
it difficult to bypass the search-for-dupes bit.

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+filebug

After searching, the user is presented with a list of similar bugs and
a list of most common bugs in the current context.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.bug import print_bugs_table

    >>> print_bugs_table(user_browser.contents, "similar-bugs")
    1 Firefox does not support SVG

    >>> print_bugs_table(user_browser.contents, "most-common-bugs")
    5 Firefox install instructions should be complete

If the user doesn't see their bug already reported, they can proceed to
file the bug.

    >>> user_browser.getControl("I don't see my bug in this list").click()

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+filebug

    >>> user_browser.getControl(name="field.title").value = "a brand new bug"
    >>> user_browser.getControl(name="field.comment").value = "test"
    >>> user_browser.getControl("Submit Bug Report").click()

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+bug/...
