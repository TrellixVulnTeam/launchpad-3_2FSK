Get the PO msgid we will be working with.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POMsgSet, POMsgID, Language
>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplate
>>> pomsgid = POMsgID.byMsgid('evolution addressbook')

Now find the two po templates, one for evolution 2.1.6 upstream and one for
evolution in hoary. They should both have a message with the msgid we have
chosen. We will be working with the Spanish (ef) language.

>>> upstream_evo = POTemplate.get(1)
>>> upstream_evo.productrelease is not None
True

>>> upstream_evo.productrelease.product.name
u'evolution'

>>> hoary_evo = POTemplate.get(4)
>>> hoary_evo.distrorelease is not None
True

>>> hoary_evo.distrorelease.name
u'hoary'

>>> hoary_evo.sourcepackagename.name
u'evolution'

We will be working in (es)panol.

We need the right POMsgSet's. We'll get the PO Files, then find the po
msgset from there.

>>> upstream_pofile = upstream_evo.getPOFileByLang('es')
>>> upstream_pomsgset = upstream_pofile.messageSet(u'evolution addressbook')
>>> hoary_pofile = hoary_evo.getPOFileByLang('es')
>>> hoary_pomsgset = hoary_pofile.messageSet(u'evolution addressbook')

Show that there are no active translations and no suggestions for either
upstream or the hoary translation.

TESTING NonEditorTranslations

Let's make a submission, when we are not an editor. It should not
become the active submission, and it
