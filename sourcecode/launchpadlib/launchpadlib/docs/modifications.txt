Objects available through the web interface, such as people, have a readable
interface which is available through direct attribute access.

    >>> from launchpadlib.testing.helpers import Launchpad
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(Launchpad.tokens.salgado_change_anything)

    >>> salgado = launchpad.people.get('salgado')
    >>> salgado.display_name
    u'Guilherme Salgado'

Some of these attributes can be changed.  For example, a person can change his
or her display name.  When changing attribute values though, the changes are
not pushed to the web service until the object is explicitly saved.  This
allows us to batch the changes over the wire for efficiency.
