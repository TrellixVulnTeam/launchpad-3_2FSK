If a branch fails to mirror, that information is displayed in the mirror's
page, together with the last failure message we got when mirroring.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/jblack/+branch/+junk/devel-1.0 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Failures:...
  ...This branch failed to mirror 9 times...
  ...Last Failure:...
  ...I do not like Arch, so I am pretending it failed to mirror...

If a branch failed to mirror but no failure message was stored, then we'll
simply say that the branch failed to mirror.

  >>> thunderbird_mirror_page = str(http(r"""
  ... GET /people/stevea/+branch/thunderbird/main HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  >>> 'Failures' in thunderbird_mirror_page
  True
  >>> 'Last Failure' in thunderbird_mirror_page
  False

Ultimately, if a branch didn't failed to mirror, then we obviously won't
display any failure-related information.

  >>> gnome_terminal_page = str(http(r"""
  ... GET /people/name12/+branch/gnome-terminal/2.6 HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  >>> 'Failures' in gnome_terminal_page
  False
  >>> 'Last Failure' in gnome_terminal_page
  False
