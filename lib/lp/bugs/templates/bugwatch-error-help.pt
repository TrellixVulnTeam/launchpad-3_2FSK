    <h1>Bug watch update errors</h1>
    <p>
      Bug watches don't always update successfully. When a bug watch
      fails to update, Launchpad records what went wrong.
    </p>
    <a name="UNKNOWN"></a>
    <h2>Unknown error (Launchpad couldn't import bug)</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad encountered an unexpected error when trying to retrieve
      the bug from the remote server.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/support">Contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="BUG_NOT_FOUND"></a>
    <h2>Bug Not Found</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad could not find the specified bug on the remote server.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      Check that the remote bug
      (<a tal:replace="structure watch/fmt:external-link" />)
      exists on the external bug tracker. If it doesn't, you should try
      to find the correct bug and
      <a tal:attributes="href watch/fmt:url">update the watch</a> so
      that it points to the correct remote bug.
    </p>
    <a name="CONNECTION_ERROR"></a>
    <h2>Connection Error</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad was unable to connect to the remote server.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      Check that the remote bug tracker
      (<a tal:replace="structure watch/bugtracker/fmt:external-link" />)
      is on-line. If it is, you should
      <a href="/support">contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="INVALID_BUG_ID"></a>
    <h2>Invalid Bug ID</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      The remote bug ID that the bug watch is linked to isn't valid on
      the remote bug tracker.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/support">Contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="TIMEOUT"></a>
    <h2>Timeout</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad encountered a timeout when trying to connect to the
      remote server and was unable to retrieve the bug's status.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/support">Contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check that the remote bug tracker
      (<a tal:replace="structure watch/bugtracker/fmt:external-link" />)
      is on-line. If it is, you should
      <a href="/support">contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="UNPARSABLE_BUG"></a>
    <h2>Unparsable Bug</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad could not extract a status from the data it received
      from the remote server.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      Check the <a attributes="href watch/fmt:url">bug watch page</a> to
      see if this error has happened more than once. If it hasn't, it
      could be due to bad data in the most recent update.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the error has occurred more than once, you should
      <a href="/support">contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="UNPARSABLE_BUG_TRACKER"></a>
    <h2>Unparsable Bug Tracker Version</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Launchpad could not determine the version of the bug tracker
      software running on the remote server.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/support">Contact us</a> and let us
      know about the problem.
    </p>
    <a name="UNSUPPORTED_BUG_TRACKER"></a>
    <h2>Unsupported Bugtracker</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      The remote server is using bug tracker software which Launchpad
      does not currently support.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+filebug"
      >File a bug</a> requesting that Launchpad support interactions
      with the remote bug tracker.
    </p>
    <a name="PRIVATE_REMOTE_BUG"></a>
    <h2>Private Remote Bug</h2>
    <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      The bug is marked as private on the remote bug tracker.  Launchpad
      cannot import the status of private remote bugs.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I help fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately there isn't a lot that can be done about this.
      You can manually update any bug task linked to the bug watch by
      choosing "None, the status of the bug is updated manually" for
      the Remote Watch option of each linked bug task.
