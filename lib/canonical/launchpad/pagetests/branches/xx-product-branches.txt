= Product Branches Overview =

Branch listing pages now hide dormant branches by default.  Dormant
branches are branches that have not been updated or committed to for
some time.  Since this is a time based change all the branches
are reset here to be recently updated.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.branch_helper import (
    ...     reset_all_branch_last_modified)
    >>> reset_all_branch_last_modified()


== Getting to the branch listing for a product ==

The default page for the code rootsite on a product is the code
overview page.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/applets')
    >>> print browser.title
    Code overview for Gnome Applets

To get to the complete branch listing, the user clicks on the
link:

    >>> browser.getLink('List branches').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Gnome Applets's Bazaar branches registered in Launchpad
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents).h1)
    Bazaar branches for Gnome Applets

If there are not any branches, a relevant message is shown.

    >>> message = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message')
    >>> print extract_text(message)
    There are no branches registered for Gnome Applets in Launchpad today.
    We recommend you visit www.bazaar-vcs.org
    for more information about how you can use
    the Bazaar revision control system to improve community
    participation in this project.

If there are branches, but they do not fit with the appropriate filter
we are given a different message.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox/+branches'
    ...     '?field.lifecycle=Mature')
    >>> message = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message')
    >>> print extract_text(message)
    There are branches registered for Mozilla Firefox but none of them match
    the current filter criteria for this page. Try filtering on "Any Status".
