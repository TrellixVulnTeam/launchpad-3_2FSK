Introduction
============

Vocabularies are lists of terms. In Launchpad's Component Architecture (CA), a
vocabulary is a list of terms that a widget (normally a selection style widget)
"speaks", i.e. its allowed values.

This document is about some of the vocabularies found in Launchpad.

Values, Tokens, and Titles
==========================

In Launchpad, we generally use "tokenized vocabularies." Each term in a
vocabulary has a value, token and title. In human terms, a term would be
rendered in a select widget like this:

<option value="$token">$title</option>

The Value is probably the data you would store in your DB. The Token is used to
uniquely identify a Term, and the Title is the thing you display to the user.

Have a look at a few of the vocabularies below for clarification.

Launchpad Vocabularies
======================

There are two kinds of vocabularies in Launchpad: enumerable and
non-enumerable. In human terms, enumerable vocabularies are short and sweet
enough to render in a select widget, where non-enumerable vocabularies require
a special query interface to make it easy to choose just one or a couple of
options from several hundred, or several thousand, or more.

Enumerable Vocabularies
=======================

XXX: document your vocabularies here please!

Non-Enumerable Vocabularies
===========================

o ProductVocabulary - the list of selectable products.

    >>> from zope.schema.vocabulary import getVocabularyRegistry
    >>> vocabulary_registry = getVocabularyRegistry()
    >>> product_vocabulary = vocabulary_registry.get(None, "Product")
    >>> gnome_products = product_vocabulary.search("gnome")
    >>> [product_term.title for product_term in gnome_products]
    [u'The Evolution Groupware Application', u'The GNOME Terminal Emulator', u'python gnome2 dev', u'The Gnome Panel Applets', u'Ubuntu']
    >>> arch = product_vocabulary.getTermByToken("arch-mirrors")
    >>> arch.title 
    u'Arch archive mirrors'

XXX: document more vocabularies here, particularly when they break!
