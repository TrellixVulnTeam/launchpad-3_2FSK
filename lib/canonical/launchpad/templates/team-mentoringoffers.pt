    This list describes bugs and features which people have offered to
    mentor. If you would like to join the "<span

    good items to work on.

  <p>
    Nobody has yet offered to mentor bug fixes or feature implementations
    which are relevant to this team. You can learn more about this
    capability in Launchpad, which allows you to create an "onramp to team
    membership" consisting of bite-sized chunks of work for new people who
    want to contribute or to prove their worth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use this feature with large teams, or large communities, to help new
    participants find their feet and make useful contributions to your
    project. Just encourage members of your team to offer mentoring on bugs
    or specs which they know how to fix or implement, but dn't have time to
    get to just yet. Those will show up in a list here, and it then becomes
    easy to point new people at the list when they offer to help out but
    don't know where to get started.
