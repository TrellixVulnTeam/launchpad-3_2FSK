    <h1>Bug heat</h1>

    <p>
      Launchpad helps you to appraise a bug by giving you a calculated measure
      &mdash; called bug heat &mdash; of its likely significance.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can see bug heat in bug listings, and also on individual bug pages,
      as four flames: the more flames that are lit, the higher the bug's
      <em>heat</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Launchpad works out how many flames to light by calculating a bug heat
      score and then seeing how that compares with the bug heat of other bugs
      for that project. However, because the number itself doesn't mean
      anything unless viewed in the context of other bugs in the project,
      Launchpad doesn't display the bug heat score itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      To calculate the bug heat score, Launchpad looks at the bug's:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>privacy status</li>
      <li>security status</li>
      <li>number of subscribers</li>
      <li>number of duplicates</li>
      <li>number of people who've selected the "this bug affects me" option
      <li>length of time since the last action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Launchpad calculates bug heat &mdash; the detailed version</h2>

    <p>
      Here's exactly how Launchpad calculates the bug heat score. First
      Launchpad gives the bug a base score:
    </p>

    <table width="100%">
      <tr>
        <th>
          <strong>Attribute</strong>
        </th>
        <th>
          <strong>Calculation</strong>
        </th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Private
        </td>
        <td>
          Adds 150 points
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Security issue
        </td>
        <td>
          Adds 250 points
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Duplicates
        </td>
        <td>
          Adds 6 points per duplicate bug
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Affected users
        </td>
        <td>
          Adds 4 points per affected user
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Subscribers (incl. subscribers to duplicates)
        </td>
        <td>
          Adds 2 points per subscriber
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Next, it adjusts the score depending on how active the bug is:
    </p>

    <table width="100%">
      <tr>
        <th>
          <strong>Nature of recent activity</strong>
        </th>
        <th>
          <strong>Calculation</strong>
        </th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Bug has been active* within the past 24 hours
        </td>
        <td>
          Add 25% of the project's <em>hottest</em> bug's score divided by the
          number of days since the first activity on the bug in question
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Bug has <strong>not</strong> been active* in within the past 24
          hours
        </td>
        <td>
          Subtract 1% of the bug heat score for every day of inactivity
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      <small><em>* Activity is either a comment posted or some other update to
      the bug report.</em></small>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some bug statuses will also affect the overall score:
    </p>

    <table width="100%">
      <tr>
        <th>
          <strong>Status</strong>
        </th>
        <th>
          <strong>Affect on bug heat score</strong>
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Fix Released
        </td>
        <td rowspan="4">
          Reduces the total bug heat score to zero
        </td>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Invalid
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Won't Fix
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Expired
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
