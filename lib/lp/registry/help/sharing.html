    <p>
        Launchpad has three kinds of restricted information &mdash;
        proprietary, embargoed and user-data. You'll only see them if they're
        shared with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also three ways to share &mdash; share all, share some or
        share none.
    </p>

    <h3>Share some</h3>

    <p>
        If you are a project maintainer, you may need to share a single bug or
        branch within a project a user or team to address an issue. You can
        share proprietary, embargoed security, or user-data bugs and branches
        by subscribing users and teams to the bug or branch. You can then view
        the exceptional bugs and branches that you've shared.
    </p>
