You didn't specify the project, distribution, or package that the bug is about.

To do this, include a line that starts with a blank space, then the word 'affects', then the Launchpad ID of the project or distribution, then (if it's a package) a slash and the name of the package.

For example, reporting a bug on an upstream project:

 affects bzr

Reporting a bug on a distribution:

 affects ubuntu

Reporting a bug on a distribution source package:

 affects ubuntu/firefox
