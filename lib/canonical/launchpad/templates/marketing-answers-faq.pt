      <p>With Launchpad's Answer Tracker your project's community can track and answer
         user support questions. Answers are searchable, so they build into a

    <h5 id="q1">What does the Answer Tracker offer that forums and mailing
                lists can't?</h5>
    <p>Launchpad's Answer Tracker makes it easy to keep track of which people
       want help, and which people have had their problem solved. All new
       requests are met with suggested answers drawn from previous requests,
       and you can get an instant overview of current user issues. While
       forums and mailing lists will always be an important way for
       communities to develop around open source projects, the Answer Tracker
       is an excellent streamlined way to build a knowledge-base and provide a
       support channel.

    <h5 id="q2">How can I make sure user questions are seen by the right
                people?</h5>
    <p>Experienced users of your software can volunteer to become support
       contacts for your project. Each time a new question is asked, the
       Answer Tracker emails it to them, with a link to provide an answer or
       request more information.
