Security Teams
==============

Responsibility for security-related bugs, whether undisclosed or public,
are modelled in Launchpad with a "security contact" on a Distribution or
a Product.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).get(1)
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).get(4)
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)

    >>> sabdfl = personset.get(1)
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.get(17)

Security contacts are set with properties.

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> ubuntu.securitycontact = sabdfl
    >>> firefox.securitycontact = ubuntu_team

    >>> print ubuntu.securitycontact.name
    sabdfl

    >>> print firefox.securitycontact.name
    name12

When creating a bug, use the security_related flag to indicate that the
bug should be flagged as security-related, and the security contact
subscribed to the bug. Note that the security setting of a bug is
completely independent of the visibility of the bug, and no relationship
should be assumed between them.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag

    >>> ubuntu_firefox = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")
    >>> bug = ubuntu.createBug(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="a security bug",
    ...     comment="this is an example security bug",
    ...     security_related=True)

The reporter, Foo Bar, and the Ubuntu security contact, Mark
Shuttleworth are both subscribed to the bug.

    >>> sorted([subscription.person.name for subscription in bug.subscriptions])
    [u'name12', u'sabdfl']

Likewise, filing a security-related bug on Firefox will subscribe the
security contact, the Ubuntu team, to the bug.

    >>> bug = firefox.createBug(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="another security bug",
    ...     comment="this is another security bug",
    ...     security_related=True)

    >>> sorted([subscription.person.name for subscription in bug.subscriptions])
    [u'name16', u'ubuntu-team']
