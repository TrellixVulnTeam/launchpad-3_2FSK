    Preconditions:
      The distroseries must exist, and be completly unused, with no source
      or binary packages existing, as well as no distroarchseries set up.
      Section and component selections must be empty. It must not have a
      parent series.

    Outcome:
      The distroarchseries set up in the parent series will be copied.
      The publishing structure will be copied from the parent. All
      PUBLISHED and PENDING packages in the parent will be created in
      this distroseries and its distroarchseriess. All component and section
      selections will be duplicated, as will any permission-related
      structures.

    Note:
      This method will raise a InitialisationError when the pre-conditions
      are not met. After this is run, you still need to construct chroots
      for building, you need to add anything missing wrt. ports etc. This
      method is only meant to give you a basic copy of a parent series in
      order to assist you in preparing a new series of a distribution or
      in the initialisation of a derivative.
