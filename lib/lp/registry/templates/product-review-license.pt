          Examine the project's overview tab first, then examine if the
          project is using code, bugs, etc.... Mark the project reviewed now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Does the project appear to be legitimate? Are its licenses simple
          and clearly open and free? Mark the project approved now.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the project appears legitimate, yet incomplete, that is fine.
          Approve the project, consider sending a request to ask the owner to
          update his project with more details because it will help him
          get contributors.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few reasons you may want to withhold approval, and you
          should contact the project owner if you do.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The project has no license.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project has only Other/Open source selected as a license and
            the license info field does not contain a URL to a license, or
            contains the whole license
          </li>
          <li>
            The Other/Open source license appears to discriminate against who
            or how the project's work is used.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project is too vague to know if it is legitimate.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If the project looks like a test, a prank, or spam, deactivate it.
