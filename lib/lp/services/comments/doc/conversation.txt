= Launchpad Comments =

The comments service module provides some interfaces to handle consistent
rendering of comments within Launchpad.


== How does it work? ==

In pages where a conversation is to be rendered, the view should provide an
attribute that provides the IConversation interface.  This is then rendered
using the +render view on the interface.

   <tal:conversation replace="structure view/conversation/@@+render"/>

Each comment in the conversation's comment list is then rendered using the
standard Launchpad style.  This is defined in the templates directory as
xxx-todo-fillin.
