= MO file format exporter =

MO files are binary files compiled from human readable PO files by an
external program, usually msgfmt(1).  One mnemonic to help you remember
these is that MO files are machine friendly and PO files are people
friendly.

You can read more about MO file format on:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_10.html#MO-Files

Launchpad gets .po file content and 'compiles' it to get
the binary form.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.translationformat.tests.helpers import (
    ...     is_valid_mofile)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.translationformat.gettext_mo_exporter import (
    ...     POCompiler)

    >>> compiler = POCompiler()


POCompiler.compile gets a string with .po file content and gives you
a .mo file binary stream.

    >>> mofile_content = compiler.compile('''
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "bar"
    ... ''')
    >>> is_valid_mofile(mofile_content)
    True

Though, if we provide it with something that is not a .po file content, we
get an export error exception:

    >>> mofile = compiler.compile('''
    ... blah
    ... ''')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UnknownTranslationExporterError: ...
