database-frozen.txt
-------------------

If a file called 'database-frozen.txt' exists in the root of the
Launchpad tree, then merges containing database changes will be rejected
by PQM. Check the top level Makefile for the current rules on what this
means.

Status
------
Database patches can be landed at the moment. Beta code updates are
blocked. If this is a problem, notify stub.

Next DB freeze scheduled May 24th.
