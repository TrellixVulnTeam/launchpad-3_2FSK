OpenId
======

Launchpad is an OpenId server. If the URL is accessed by a web browser,
an informative message is displayed. We replicate the one from the
specification exactly, even though other OpenId servers take more
liberties.

>>> anon_browser.open('http://openid.launchpad.dev')
>>> print anon_browser.headers
Status: 200 Ok
...
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8

>>> print anon_browser.contents
...
This is an OpenID server endpoint. For more information, see http://openid.net/
