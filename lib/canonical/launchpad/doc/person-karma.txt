People karma
============

In Launchpad, everytime a user performs an action, we give him some karma
points. These karma points are stored in the KarmaAction table and the
assignment to a user is made in the Karma table. The method used to calculate
a users karma is time-dependent, because we want to give more karma points for
actions performed recently. This method is described in 
https://launchpad.canonical.com/KarmaImplementation.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IPersonSet, IPerson, IKarma, IKarmaCache)
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)

Depending on the action a given person performs in Launchpad, that person can
earn some karma points. This is useful to know how active a user is in
Launchpad.

Salgado wrote the karma framework. Let's give him some karma points.

    >>> salgado = personset.getByName('salgado')
    >>> salgado_karma = salgado.assignKarma('bugfixed')

assignKarma() returns an object implementing IKarma.

    >>> verifyObject(IKarma, salgado_karma)
    True

The value that you get through IPerson.karma is a cached value that's
calculated daily. That's why it still 0.

    >>> salgado.karma
    0

The assignKarma() method will trigger a KarmaAssignedEvent, to notify clients
that karma was assigned to a given person.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.event import TestEventListener
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event.interfaces import IKarmaAssignedEvent
    >>> def on_assigned_event(person, event):
    ...     print "IKarmaAssignedEvent: %r" % event

    >>> on_assigned_listener = TestEventListener(
    ...     IPerson, IKarmaAssignedEvent, on_assigned_event)

    >>> dummy = salgado.assignKarma('bugfixed')
    IKarmaAssignedEvent: <canonical.launchpad.event.karma.KarmaAssignedEvent...

    >>> on_assigned_listener.unregister()


Karma Updater
-------------

It would be a problem if every time we wanted to see a user's total karma we
had to calculate it, so we decided to cache this total and update it
periodically. This cache is stored in the KarmaCache table and is updated by
the foaf-update-karma-cache.py cronscript.

    (Let's commit the current transaction because the script will run in
    another transaction and thus it won't see the changes done on this test
    unless we commit)
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     'cronscripts/foaf-update-karma-cache.py -q', shell=True,
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> out, err
    ('', '')
    >>> process.returncode
    0

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_caches
    >>> flush_database_caches()
    >>> salgado.karma
    20
