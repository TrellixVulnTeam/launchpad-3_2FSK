# Put your TODOs for this branch here, then make sure it is empty before
# landing. There is a test to ensure it is empty in trunk. If there is
# stuff still here when you are ready to land, the items should probably
# be converted to bugs so they can be scheduled.

- Need a custom LaunchpadImageFolder and IcingFolder which first delegates to
the default ones used by Launchpad and if the resource is not found look for
it in a vostok-specific folder.
