= OAuth =

This is a mechanism for allowing a third party application to access
Launchpad on a user's behalf.  These applications are identified by a
unique key and are stored as OAuthConsumers.

These applications (also called consumers) are managed by the
OAuthConsumerSet utility.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IOAuthConsumer, IOAuthConsumerSet)
    >>> consumer_set = getUtility(IOAuthConsumerSet)
    >>> verifyObject(IOAuthConsumerSet, consumer_set)
    True

    >>> consumer = consumer_set.new(key='asdfg')
    >>> verifyObject(IOAuthConsumer, consumer)
    True

    >>> consumer_set.getByKey('asdfg') == consumer
    True

    >>> print consumer_set.getByKey('gfdsa')
    None

As mentioned above, the keys are unique, so we can't create a second Consumer
with the same key.

    >>> consumer_set.new(key='asdfg')
