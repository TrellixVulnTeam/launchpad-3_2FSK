We recently made obsolete two URLs in Malone:

1. The Anorak bug listing URL:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET http://localhost:8085/malone/bugs HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-ca,en-us;q=0.8,en;q=0.5,fr-ca;q=0.3
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...

There is currently no replacement for this URL, but
/malone/bugs/$bug.id will continue to work, for the time being.

2. The tasks namespace:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET http://localhost:8085/malone/tasks HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-ca,en-us;q=0.8,en;q=0.5,fr-ca;q=0.3
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...

Tasks are now accessed "contextually", like
/products/firefox/+bugs/$bug.id. The entire /malone/tasks namespace
has been obsoleted, to prevent user confusion over which ID to use
when referring to a bug.
