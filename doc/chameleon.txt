Running Launchpad with Chameleon Template Engine
================================================

- Need to pull the following dependencies into ``sourcecode``:

  - lp:sourcecodegen/trunk
  - lp:chameleon.core/trunk
  - lp:chameleon.zpt/trunk
  - lp:z3c.pt/trunk
  - lp:z3c.ptcompat/trunk

- Run launchpad with ``PREFER_Z3C_PT=true make run`` to enable
  ``z3c.pt``. Omitting it or setting to ``false`` will disable
  ``z3c.pt`` and use ``zope.pagetemplate`` instead. Yes, it's that
  simple. This is possible thanks to ``z3c.ptcompat``.


Other useful environment options for ``z3c.pt``::

  # in debug-mode, templates on disk are reloaded if they're modified
  CHAMELEON_DEBUG (default: false)

  # disable disk-cache to prevent the compiler from caching on disk
  CHAMELEON_CACHE (default: true)

  # if eager parsing is enabled, templates are parsed upon
  # instantiation, rather than when first called upon; this mode is
  # useful for verifying validity of templates across a project
  CHAMELEON_EAGER (default: false)

  # in strict mode, filled macro slots must exist in the macro that's
  # being used.
  CHAMELEON_STRICT (default: false)

  # when validation is enabled, dynamically inserted content is
  # validated against the XHTML standard
  CHAMELEON_VALIDATE (default: false)
