Team membership views
=====================


Breadcrumbs
-----------

Team membership breadcrumbs uses the member's displayname to create
"<displayname>'s membership".

    >>> from canonical.lazr.testing.menus import make_fake_request
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.teammembership import ITeamMembershipSet

    >>> teamowner = factory.makePerson(name='teamowner')
    >>> team = factory.makeTeam(name='us', owner=teamowner)
    >>> membership = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet).getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     teamowner, team)
    >>> view = create_view(membership, '+index')

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~us/+member/teamowner',
    ...     [team, membership, view])
    >>> hierarchy = create_initialized_view(
    ...     membership, '+hierarchy', request=request)
    >>> hierarchy.items
    [<TeamBreadcrumb ... text='\u201cUs\u201d team'>,
     <TeamMembershipBreadcrumb ... text='Teamowner's membership'>]


+member view
------------

The TeamMembershipEditView provides a label that described the membership
state of the IPerson.

    >>> view = create_view(membership, '+index')
    >>> print view.label

When a team is invited to join another team, the TeamInvitationsView controls
the ~team/+invitations page.
