  Now, 'myemail' is a MODERATED team, and 'salgado' will join again.

  Let's see if the team owner received an email notification that there's a
  new member waiting for approval. (this notification is sent to all team
  administrators, but in this case we don't have team administrators)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
  >>> to_addrs
  ['foo@baz.com']


  Proposed Members are not shown as "real" team members by our API.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamMembership
  >>> salgado = Person.byName('salgado')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> tm = TeamMembership.selectBy(personID=salgado.id, teamID=team.id)[0]
  >>> tm.statusname
  'Proposed Member'
  >>> salgado.inTeam(team)
  False
