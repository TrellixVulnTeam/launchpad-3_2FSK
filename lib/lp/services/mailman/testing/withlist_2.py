# This is a bin/withlist script for testing that Mailman can import and access
# the common libmailman package.  It works by side effect; on success it exits
# with a return code of 99, which would be difficult to false positive, but
# very easy to check by the parent process.  See test-lpmm.txt for details.
#
# This script must be called like so:
#
# bin/withlist -r canonical.launchpad.mailman.tests.withlist_2.can_import
