  After a mirror is probed, we display its mirrored contents, together with
  the "freshness" of each content.

  For archive mirrors we have a table listing the arch releases mirrored and
  another one for the source releases mirrored.

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/+mirror/archive-mirror')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://localhost/distros/ubuntu/+mirror/archive-mirror'

  >>> print browser.contents

  flavours mirrored.
