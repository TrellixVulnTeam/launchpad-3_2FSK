Ticket Email Notifications
==========================

When a ticket is created or changed, an email notification is sent out,
informing the subscribers about the change. Let's start with creating a
ticket, and see what the resulting notification looks like:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectCreatedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> ubuntu_ticket = ubuntu.newTicket(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.")
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(ubuntu_ticket))

In order for the mails to be sent, we need to commit the transaction:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

Two copies of the notification got sent, one to the owner of the Ubuntu
distribution, and one to the submitter of the ticket, Sample Person:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2

    >>> import email
    >>> notifications = [
    ...     email.message_from_string(raw_message)
    ...     for from_addr, to_addrs, raw_message in sorted(stub.test_emails)
    ...     ]
    >>> maintainer_notification, submitter_notification = notifications
    >>> maintainer_notification['To']
    'support@ubuntu.com'
    >>> maintainer_notification['Subject']
    "[Support #8]: Can't install Ubuntu"

    >>> submitter_notification['To']
    'test@canonical.com'
    >>> submitter_notification['Subject']
    "[Support #8]: Can't install Ubuntu"
    >>> notification_body = submitter_notification.get_payload()
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    New support request #8 on ubuntu:
    http://.../distros/ubuntu/+ticket/8
    <BLANKLINE>
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> stub.test_emails = []

Let's simulate that the no-priv answers the support ticket. This
involves creating a new message, and to set the status to ANSWERED:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectModifiedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import Snapshot
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITicket
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> unmodified_ticket = Snapshot(ubuntu_ticket, providing=ITicket)
    >>> comment = ubuntu_ticket.newMessage(
    ...     no_priv, ubuntu_ticket.followup_subject,
    ...     'You have to change the boot order in the BIOS.')
    >>> ubuntu_ticket.mark_resolved(no_priv)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_ticket, unmodified_ticket, ['messages', 'status']))

As before, two copies of the notification got sent:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2

    >>> notifications = [
    ...     email.message_from_string(raw_message)
    ...     for from_addr, to_addrs, raw_message in sorted(stub.test_emails)
    ...     ]
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> edit_notification['Subject']
    "[Support #8]: Re: Can't install Ubuntu"

    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Support request #8 on ubuntu changed:
    http://.../distros/ubuntu/+ticket/8
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: New => Answered
    <BLANKLINE>
    Comment:
    You have to change the boot order in the BIOS.
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> stub.test_emails = []

If we trigger a modification event, even though no changes worth
notifying about was made, no notification is sent:

    >>> unmodified_ticket = Snapshot(ubuntu_ticket, providing=ITicket)
    >>> ubuntu_ticket.mark_resolved(no_priv) # The ticket is already resolved.
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_ticket, unmodified_ticket, ['status']))

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

If we create a bug from the support request, it will be reported as a
bug that has been linked to the request:

    >>> unmodified_ticket = Snapshot(ubuntu_ticket, providing=ITicket)
    >>> bug = unmodified_ticket.target.createBug(
    ...     no_priv, unmodified_ticket.title, unmodified_ticket.description)
    >>> unmodified_ticket.linkBug(bug)
    <TicketBug...>
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_ticket, unmodified_ticket, ['bugs']))

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2

    >>> notifications = [
    ...     email.message_from_string(raw_message)
    ...     for from_addr, to_addrs, raw_message in sorted(stub.test_emails)
    ...     ]
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
