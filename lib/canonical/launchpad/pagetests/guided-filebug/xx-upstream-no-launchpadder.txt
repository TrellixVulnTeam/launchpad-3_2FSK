We do some special-handling of the cases where upstream doesn't use
Malone as their official bugtracker. In this situation, we want to tell
people what their options are. Alsa-utils, for instance, doesn't use
Malone:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/alsa-utils/+filebug')
    >>> "does not use Malone" in user_browser.contents
    True
    >>> user_browser.getControl(name="field.title")
    ...
    LookupError...

But it's packaged in Ubuntu and Debian, and we suggest those packages
for filing bugs:

    >>> "Ubuntu alsa-utils" in user_browser.contents
    True

We don't know what bug tracker they use either:

    >>> "doesn't know what bug tracker" in user_browser.contents
    True

Gnomebaker doesn't use Malone either. We don't have packaging
information for it:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/gnomebaker/+filebug')
    >>> "does not use Malone" in user_browser.contents
    True
    >>> user_browser.getLink("telling Launchpad") is not None
    True

But we do know what tracker it uses:

    >>> user_browser.getLink("GnomeGBug GTracker") is not None
    True

Distributions have less options available if they don't use Malone:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/debian/+filebug')
    >>> "does not use Malone" in user_browser.contents
    True
