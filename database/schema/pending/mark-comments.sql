COMMENT ON TABLE ProcessorFamily IS 'An architecture, that might consist of several actual processors. Different distributions call these architectures different things, so we have an "architecturetag" in DistroArchRelease that might be different to the architecture\'s name.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ProcessorFamily.name IS 'The name of the architecture. This is a short unix-style name such as i386 or amd64';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ProcessorFamily.title IS 'A title for the architecture. For example "Intel i386 Compatible".';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ProcessorFamily.description IS 'A description for this processor family. It might include any gotchas such as the fact that i386 does not necessarily mean that code would run on a 386... Ubuntu for example requires a 486.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ProcessorFamily.owner IS 'The person responsible for this processor family entry.';


COMMENT ON TABLE Processor IS 'A single processor for which code might be compiled. For example, i386, P2, P3, P4, Itanium1, Itanium2... each processor belongs to a ProcessorFamily, and it might be that a package is compiled several times for a given Family, with different optimisation settings for each processor.';
COMMENT ON TABLE Processor.name IS 'The name of this processor, for example, i386, Pentium, P2, P3, P4, Itanium, Itanium2, K7, Athlon, Opteron... it should be short and unique.';
COMMENT ON TABLE Processor.family IS 'The ProcessorFamily for this Processor.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DistroArchRelease.processorfamily IS 'A link to the ProcessorFamily table, giving the architecture of this DistroArchRelease.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN DistroArchRelease.architecturetag IS 'The name of this architecture in the context of this specific distro release. For example, some distributions might label amd64 as amd64, others might call is x86_64. This information is used, for example, in determining the names of the actual package files... such as the "amd64" part of "apache2_2.0.56-1_amd64.deb"';
