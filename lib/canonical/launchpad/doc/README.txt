This directory contains the Launchpad system documentation. The intent is for
the documentation found in this directory to:

- describe various aspects of the Launchpad system: adapters, utilities, event
  handlers and other things of interest to people that want to make things work
  in Launchpad

- be executable, and test the code that it documents, i.e. doctests
