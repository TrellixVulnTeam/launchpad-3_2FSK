"""Create dummy Bazaar branches for all HOSTED branches in the database.

The Launchpad sample data includes a number of HOSTED branches that users can
branch from, push to and view on the website. However, some of these things
will break if we are missing the actual Bazaar branches, so we have a script
to create them.

NOTE: This script will delete any existing sample data branches, so that the
sample data on the filesystem is consistent with the sample data in the
database.
