(This mirror monitoring system is in beta and is being actively developed.)

Dear mirror administrator,

This is an automated failure notice that has been generated by the mirror
content checker.

A possible failure has been detected on the following mirror:

    %(mirror_name)s of %(distro)s
    %(mirror_url)s

You are being notified because you are the registered contact in
Launchpad for this mirror.

The mirror content checker failed to locate any files that a
%(distro)s mirror should contain, and so we'll stop probing it.  The
log file[1] of the content check should give you more detailed
information of what failed.

To have this mirror shown on mirror listings again, you should:

* Verify the details registered in Launchpad for this mirror.

* Ensure the path to the mirror contents is correct.

If this was a temporary failure and has been now corrected, the mirror will
appear on the mirror listings right after the next content check.

If all the details are correct and the mirror is reachable, this report
may be due to a problem with the mirror checker.  If you believe this to
be the case, please help us by filing a bug at:

Thanks,

The Launchpad Team
