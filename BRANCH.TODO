# Put your TODOs for this branch here, then make sure it is empty before
# landing. There is a test to ensure it is empty in trunk. If there is
# stuff still here when you are ready to land, the items should probably
# be converted to bugs so they can be scheduled.

- for KarmaActionEditView I'll have to write a test -- the only existing one
is in standalone/xx-karmaaction.txt and doesn't actually test it.
