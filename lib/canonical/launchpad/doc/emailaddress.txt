Email Address
=============

In Launchpad we use email addresses to uniquely identify a person. This is why
email addresses must be unique.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IEmailAddressSet, IPersonSet
  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> foobar = personset.getByName('name16')
  >>> emailset = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet)
  >>> emailset.getByEmail('test@canonical.com').email
  u'test@canonical.com'


Trying to register an email address that already exists will raise an
exception.

  >>> emailset.new('test@canonical.com', foobar)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  EmailAddressAlreadyTaken: The email address test@canonical.com is already registered.


All email addresses operations are case insensitive.

  >>> emailset.new('Test@Canonical.com', foobar)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  EmailAddressAlreadyTaken: The email address Test@Canonical.com is already registered.
