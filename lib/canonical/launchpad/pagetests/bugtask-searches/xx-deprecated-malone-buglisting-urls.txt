We've recently changed the URL paths in Malone for viewing bugs on
things.

The new URL path for bugs on a distro is:

    /$distro.name/+bugs

The old URL path for distro bugs still works, for now:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /bugs/debian HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

The URL path for bugs on a distro release is:

    /bugs/$distro.name/$distrorelease.name/+bugs

The old URL path for distro release bugs still works, for now:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /bugs/debian/sid HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

The URL path for bugs on an upstream product is:

    /bugs/$product.name/+bugs

The old URL path for upstream still works though, for now:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /bugs/products/firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
