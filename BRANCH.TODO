# Put your TODOs for this branch here, then make sure it is empty before
# landing. There is a test to ensure it is empty in trunk. If there is
# stuff still here when you are ready to land, the items should probably
# be converted to bugs so they can be scheduled.

In test_remove_translations.py, there's still an XXX for bug 261507.
Resolve that before landing this branch.  Danilo should already have
that fix ready.
