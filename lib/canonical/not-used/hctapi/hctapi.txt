HCT Backend API
===============

The hctapi module contains an implementation of the HCT backend API
that talks directly to the Launchpad database, creating HCT objects
from database objects and vice-versa.

We should be able to import it.

FIXME: Currently broken due to the branch changes. See bug #4117.

    #>>> from canonical.launchpad import hctapi

Importing it should automatically register it with the HCT URL system,
and make it the default backend.

    #>>> import hct.url
    #>>> print hct.url.default_scheme
    #lp

Further tests for this backend are done in pyunit style, and can be
found in lib/canonical/launchpad/tests/test_hctapi.py.
