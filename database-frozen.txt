database-frozen.txt
-------------------

If a file called 'database-frozen.txt' exists in the root of the
Launchpad tree, then merges containing database changes will be rejected
by PQM. Check the top level Makefile for the current rules on what this
means.

Status
------
Database patches are frozen. Roll out is scheduled late May 24th. Once
roll out is enacted edge and beta code updates will be reenabled.
