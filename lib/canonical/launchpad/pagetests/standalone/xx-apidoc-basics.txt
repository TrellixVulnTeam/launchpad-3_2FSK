Confirm the Zope3 apidoc online developers resource is *not* available -
it is more important to test that is is being blocked correctly than that
it renders correctly, and we can only test one case with the current
Z3 functional test harnesses.

  >>> try:
  ...     http(r"""
  ... GET /++apidoc++ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  ...     print "Access granted"
  ... except AttributeError:
  ...     print "Access denied"
  Access denied


Make sure that Z3 resources are available through the preferred Z3
spelling, as used by apidoc.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /@@/favicon.png HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

And the resourceDirectives are available too

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /@@/tree_images/minus_vline.png HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
