Launchpad's API docs

It is generated by the zope.app.apidoc package, and can be seen on
apidoc.launchpad.dev.  

The below call fails with the following exception:
NotFound: Object: <canonical.launchpad.systemhomes.APIDocRoot object at
0xc4c7550>, name: u'++apidoc++'

It's probably because ++apidoc++ is handled in some special manner when not
running the tests because there's nothing you can traverse to from an
APIDocRoot object.

    >>> browser.open('http://apidoc.launchpad.dev')

    >>> browser.contents


It is only available when devmode is on.
