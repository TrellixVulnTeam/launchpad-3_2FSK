Turning a Ticket into a Bug
===========================

The ticket page should show a link to make the ticket into a bug.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Convert To Bug...

And the +makebug should be visible (note that it should only be visible when
there are no linked bugs, but that is rather hard to test with the current
testing setup).

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+makebug HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

POSTing that form back to the ticket page should show a portal message
giving the new bug number, and should show the bug in the list of related
bugs.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 18
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... makebug=Create+Bug""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Thank you! Bug...created...
