Each product in Launchpad has a Translations page.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+translations')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/products/evolution/+translations'
    >>> print browser.contents
    <...
    ...Translations of The Evolution Groupware Application...
    ...
    ...For Evolution, Launchpad currently recommends...
    ...Evolution trunk...
    ...


If a product is not set up for translations in Rosetta, and you are its
registrant or an admin, the Translations page suggests that you set it up for
translation, or link the product to a translatable package.

    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser

    >>> registrant = Browser()
    >>> registrant.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic mark@hbd.com:test')
    >>> registrant.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/+translations')
    >>> print registrant.contents
    <...
    ...How to set up translations...
    ...
    >>> 'trunk/+translations-upload' in registrant.contents
    True
    >>> '/products/alsa-utils/+packages' in registrant.contents
    True

(The template upload process is tested in xx-translation-import-queue.txt.)


If you're logged in as someone else, the Translations page suggests that you
contact the product's registrant.

    >>> unprivileged = Browser()
    >>> unprivileged.addHeader(
    ...     'Authorization', 'Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> unprivileged.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/+translations')
    >>> print unprivileged.contents
    <...
    ...talk with...Mark Shuttleworth...
    ...

It omits the registrant-only links ...

    >>> 'trunk/+translations-upload' in unprivileged.contents
    False
    >>> '/products/alsa-utils/+packages' in unprivileged.contents
    False

... because you can't do those things.

    >>> unprivileged.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/trunk/+translations-upload')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden

(In the packages case, you can look at the packages, but you can't link any.)

    >>> unprivileged.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/trunk/+addpackage')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden


Meanwhile, if you're not logged in at all, you might or might not be the
registrant, so the text reflects both possibilities.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/products/alsa-utils/+translations')
    >>> print anon_browser.contents
    <...
    ...If you&#8217;re Mark Shuttleworth,...
    .../products/alsa-utils/+translations/+login"...log in...
    ...
    ...Otherwise...
    ...talk with...Mark Shuttleworth...
    ...
