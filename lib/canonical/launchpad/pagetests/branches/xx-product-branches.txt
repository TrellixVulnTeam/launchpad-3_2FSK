= Branches Overview =

Products should link their branch listing page.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/gnome-terminal')
  >>> browser.getLink('Code').url
  'http://code.launchpad.dev/products/gnome-terminal/'

There are two listings of branches for a product. The short tabular listing,
and the detailed branch listing that includes branch summaries and more
hyperlinks. We'll use the presence of the summary for the Gnome Terminal
Mainline branch to distinguish the pages.

  >>> gterm_main_summary = "Release branch of GNOME Terminal for the GNOME 2.6 environment."

We should be able to display a list of branches for a product at +branches.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/gnome-terminal/+branches')
  >>> gterm_main_summary in browser.contents
  False

And another at +branchlisting. That one is the detailed branch listing.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/gnome-terminal/+branchlisting')
  >>> gterm_main_summary in browser.contents
  True

If there are no branches, we should display a message stating that there is no
branch registered for this product.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/applets/+branchlisting')
  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...There are no branches registered for...
