= Edubuntu is no more =

As of 8.10 we stopped making Edubuntu CDs, so its home page is a completely
different one which just tells the user to download the CD image or request
an Ubuntu CD instead.

    >>> browser.open('http://shipit.edubuntu.dev')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
    Getting Edubuntu
    As of version 8.10 we are not shipping Edubuntu CDs...

And the page where used to be possible to request Edubuntu CDs doesn't
exist anymore.

    >>> browser.open('http://shipit.edubuntu.dev/myrequest')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
