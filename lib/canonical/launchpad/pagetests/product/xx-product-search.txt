We can search for products using an exact name. If one is found, we get
redirected to it directly.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /projects?exact_name=1&text=firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://localhost/firefox
  <BLANKLINE>


If one isn't found, a normal search is performed.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /projects?exact_name=1&text=mozilla HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Mozilla Firefox
  ...Mozilla Thunderbird...
