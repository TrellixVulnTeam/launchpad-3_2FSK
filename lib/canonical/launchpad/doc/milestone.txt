Milestones
==========

A milestone is a significant event in a project. A release of a new version of
a piece of software is a significant event (we're geeks, give us a break.) In
Malone, milestones can be defined to assign bug fixes to a specific release of
some software.

This document is about milestones in Malone.

Working with Milestones in Malone
=================================

All Milestone creation and retrieval is done through IMilestoneSet.
IMilestoneSet can be accessed as a utility.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMilestoneSet
    >>> milestoneset = getUtility(IMilestoneSet)

To create a new Milestone, use IMilestoneSet.new:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> upstream_firefox = productset.get(4)
    >>> firefox_ms = milestoneset.new(product = upstream_firefox, name = "1.1",
    ...                               title = "one dot one")
    >>> print firefox_ms.name
    1.1

To retrieve a specific Milestone, use IMilestoneSet.get:

    >>> firefox_ms_1_0 = milestoneset.get(1)
    >>> print firefox_ms_1_0.name
    1.0

Trying to retrieve a milestone that doesn't exist will raise a
zope.exceptions.NotFoundError:

    >>> milestoneset.get(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NotFoundError: 'Milestone with ID -1 does not exist'
