    <h1>Why do I need a "Subscription name"?</h1>

    <p>
      You may have more than one structural subscription per project, each
      with different criteria.  You may provide a name in order to identify
      them in the future in order to edit or delete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, each email generated by this subscription will quote the name
      you choose, both in the email body and as a header
      (<code>X-Launchpad-Subscription</code>), making it easy to filter
      your bug mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, please provide a short, descriptive name to help you remember this
      subscription.
