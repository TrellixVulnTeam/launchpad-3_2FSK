= Private memberships =

Some teams may have private memberships, meaning that only the team
members (and LP admins) can see who are the other members of the team.

'myteam' is a team with private memberships, so someone who's not a
team member can't see, for instance, the membership of a person on that
team.

    # XXX: 2008-08-01, salgado: Notice how the total_size is incorrect here.
    # That ought to be fixed at some point.
    >>> member = user_webservice.get("~member").jsonBody()
    >>> response = user_webservice.get(
    ...     member['memberships_details_collection_link'])
    >>> print sorted(response.jsonBody().items())
    [(u'entries', []),
     (u'resource_type_link',
      u'http://.../#team_membership-page-resource'),
     (u'start', 0),
     (u'total_size', 1)]

Salgado can, though, because he's a Launchpad admin.

    >>> response = webservice.get(
    ...     member['memberships_details_collection_link'])
    >>> print sorted(response.jsonBody().items())
    [(u'entries',
      [{u'status': u'Approved',...
        u'team_link': u'http://.../~myteam'...
     (u'resource_type_link',
      u'http://.../#team_membership-page-resource'),
     (u'start', 0),
     (u'total_size', 1)]
