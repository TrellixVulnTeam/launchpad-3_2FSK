      <p>
        The Launchpad Bug Tracker is a collaborative bug tracker for the
        Free Software universe. It works a bit differently from other
        trackers.
      </p>
      <h2>One bug, many places</h2>
      <p>
        Some people find bugs in software they install directly from its
        developers.
        Other people find bugs in software packages they install as part of
        a distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        When these are the same bug, Launchpad can link them together.
        Once one team fixes the bug, others can share the fix.
      </p>
      <h2>One world, many bug trackers</h2>
      <p>
        The more software teams use Launchpad, the more useful it becomes.
        But if a team uses Bugzilla, Sourceforge, or debbugs,
        Launchpad can link their bug reports with those in Launchpad,
        and let you know when they&#8217;re fixed.
      </p>
      <h2>How to get started</h2>
      <p>
        To use Launchpad for your project, first
        <a href="/projects">check whether it&#8217;s registered already</a>.
        The admin for a project can set that project to use Launchpad
        (this is off by default so that people don&#8217;t report bugs that
        nobody reads).
