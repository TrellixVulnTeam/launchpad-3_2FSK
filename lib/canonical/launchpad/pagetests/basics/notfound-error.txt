= 404 pages =

If you follow a link from another page to a Launchpad page that doesn't
exist, the 404 page includes a link back to the referring page.

(We can't test the 404 page using testbrowser, because it won't show us
the contents of any error page. So we use http() instead.)

    >>> page_with_referer = str(http(r"""
    ... GET /+fqwhgads HTTP/1.1
    ... Referer: http://launchpad.dev/+about
    ... """))
    >>> 'HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found' in page_with_referer
    True
    >>> 'If you got here from a link' in page_with_referer
    True
    >>> 'Check that you entered the address correctly' in page_with_referer
    False
    >>> 'http://launchpad.dev/+about' in page_with_referer
    True
    >>> 'Return to the page you came from' in page_with_referer
    True

But if you go to a non-existent page directly, without sending a
Referer: header, the 404 page includes no such link.

    >>> page_with_no_referer = str(http(r"""
    ... GET /+fqwhgads HTTP/1.1
    ... """))
    >>> 'HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found' in page_with_no_referer
    True
    >>> 'If you got here from a link' in page_with_no_referer
    False
    >>> 'Check that you entered the address correctly' in page_with_no_referer
    True
    >>> 'Return to the page you came from' in page_with_no_referer
    False
