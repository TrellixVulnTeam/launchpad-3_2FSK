= Entries =

Most objects published by the Launchpad web service are entries:
self-contained data structures with an independent existence from any
other entry. Entries are distinguished from collections, which are
groupings of entries.

All entries in the Launchpad web service work pretty much the same
way. This document illustrates the general features of entries, using
Launchpad people and bug tasks as examples.


== Reading ==

It's possible to get a JSON 'representation' of an entry by sending a
GET request to the entry's URL.

Here we see that the user 'salgado' has a display name of 'Guilherme
Salgado'.

  >>> salgado = webservice.get('/~salgado').jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'Guilherme Salgado'


== Custom operations ==

Some entries support custom operations through GET. The custom
operation to be invoked is named in the query string's 'ws_op'
argument. You can get a list of a team's active members by specifying
the 'members_by_status' operation.

  >>> active_members = webservice.get(
  ...     "/~admins?ws_op=members_by_status&status=Approved").jsonBody()
  >>> sorted([m['name'] for m in active_members['entries']])
  [u'carlos', u'daf', u'debonzi', u'kinnison', u'spiv']

Some entries support custom operations through POST. You can change a
bug's status by invoking a custom operation.

  >>> bugtask_path = '/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/+bug/1'
  >>> webservice.get(bugtask_path).jsonBody()['status']
  u'Confirmed'

  >>> print webservice.named_post(
  ...     bugtask_path, 'change_status', {}, status='Invalid')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> webservice.get(bugtask_path).jsonBody()['status']
  u'Invalid'

Custom operations may have error handling.

  >>> print webservice.get(
  ...     "/~admins?ws_op=members_by_status&status=NoSuchStatus")
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  status: Constraint not satisfied: NoSuchStatus.

  >>> print webservice.named_post(
  ...     bugtask_path, 'change_status', {}, status='NoSuchStatus')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  status: Constraint not satisfied: NoSuchStatus.

  >>> print webservice.named_post(
  ...     bugtask_path, 'change_status', {}, status='Triaged')
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  ...
  Only Bug Contacts may change status to Triaged.

Trying to invoke a nonexistent custom operation yields an error.

  >>> print webservice.get(
  ...     "/~admins?ws_op=no_such_operation")
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...


== Modification ==

It's possible to modify an entry by sending to the server a document
asserting what the entry should look like. The document may only
describe part of the entry's new state, in which case the client
should use the PATCH HTTP method. Or it may completely describe the
entry's state, in which case the client should use PUT.

  >>> import simplejson
  >>> def modify_person(person, representation, method):
  ...     "A helper function to send a PUT or PATCH request to a person."
  ...     return webservice('/~' + person, method,
  ...                       simplejson.dumps(representation),
  ...                       {'Content-type': 'application/json'})

Here we use the web service to change the user 'salgado' so that their
display name is in uppercase.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'displayname' : 'GUILHERME SALGADO'},
  ...                     'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: 0
  ...

  >>> salgado = webservice.get('/~salgado').jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'GUILHERME SALGADO'

The modification might cause the person's address to change. Here we
use the web service to change the person's name to 'salgado2'.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'name' : 'salgado2'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
  ...
  Location: http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado2
  <BLANKLINE>

At this point we can no longer manipulate the 'salgado' Person by
sending HTTP requests to http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado,
because that Person now 'lives' at
http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado2. To change 'salgado2' back to
'salgado', we need to send a PATCH request to the new address.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado2', {'name' : 'salgado'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
  ...
  Location: http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado
  <BLANKLINE>

# XXX leonardr 2008-03-10 blueprint=modify-data-links:
# A link between a person and a related object can be modified.

The PATCH HTTP method is useful for simple changes, but not all HTTP
clients support PATCH, and sometimes it's easier to GET a document,
modify it, and send it back. If you have the full document at hand,
you can use the PUT method.

We happen to have a full document from when we sent a GET request to
the 'salgado' Person. Modifying that document and PUTting it back is
less work than constructing a new document and sending it with PATCH.

  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'GUILHERME SALGADO'

  >>> salgado['displayname'] = 'Guilherme Salgado'
  >>> print modify_person('salgado', salgado, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> salgado = webservice.get('/~salgado').jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['displayname']
  u'Guilherme Salgado'

Because our patch format is the same as our representation format (a
JSON hash), any document that works with a PUT request will also work
with a PATCH request.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', salgado, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...


=== What you can't do ===

A document that would be acceptable as the payload of a PATCH request
might not be acceptable as the payload of a PUT request.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'name' : 'salgado2'}, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You didn't specify a value for the attribute 'displayname'.

A document that's not a valid JSON document is also unacceptable.

  >>> print webservice.patch("/~salgado", "application/json", "{")
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Entity-body was not a well-formed JSON document.

A document that's valid JSON but is not a JSON hash is unacceptable.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', 'name=salgado2', 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Expected a JSON hash.

An entry's read-only attributes can't be modified.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'datecreated' :
  ...                                 u'2001-01-01T01:01:01+00:00Z'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Length: 57
  Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  You tried to modify the read-only attribute 'datecreated'

You can send a document that includes a value for a read-only
attribute, but it has to be the same as the current value.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'datecreated' : salgado['datecreated']},
  ...                     'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

You can't change the link to an entry's associated collection.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado',
  ...                    {'team_memberships_collection_link' : 'dummy'},
  ...                     'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You tried to modify the collection link 'team_memberships_collection_link'

Again, you can send a document that includes a value for an associated
collection link; you just can't _change_ the value.

  >>> link = 'http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado/team_memberships'
  >>> print modify_person('salgado',
  ...                    {'team_memberships_collection_link' : link },
  ...                    'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

You can't directly change an entry's URL address.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado',
  ...                    {'self_link' : 'dummy'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You tried to modify the read-only attribute 'self_link'.

You can't refer to a link to an associated object or collection as
though it were the actual object:

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'team_memberships' : 'dummy'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You tried to modify the nonexistent attribute 'team_memberships'

  >>> print modify_person('landscape-developers', {'owner' :
  ...                     'salgado'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You tried to modify the nonexistent attribute 'owner'

You can't set values that violate Launchpad's data integrity rules.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado',
  ...                    {'name' : 'sabdfl'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  sabdfl is already in use by another person or team.

And of course you can't modify attributes that don't exist.

  >>> print modify_person('salgado', {'nonesuch' : 'dummy'}, 'PATCH')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You tried to modify the nonexistent attribute 'nonesuch'


=== Changing object relationships ===

In addition to changing an object's data fields, you can change its
relationships to other objects. Here we change the owner of the
'admins' team from 'sabdfl' to 'salgado'.

  >>> admins = webservice.get('/~admins').jsonBody()
  >>> admins['teamowner_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl'
  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'http://api.launchpad.dev/~salgado'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Identification of the owner is done by specifying a URL; a random
string won't work.

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'A random string'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Your value for the attribute 'teamowner_link' wasn't the URL to any
  object published by this web service.

But not just any URL will do. It has to identify an object in the web
service.

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'http://www.canonical.com/'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Your value for the attribute 'teamowner_link' wasn't the URL to any
  object published by this web service.

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'http://www.canonical.com/people/admins'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Your value for the attribute 'teamowner_link' wasn't the URL to any
  object published by this web service.

This URL would be valid, but it uses the wrong protocol (HTTPS instead
of HTTP).

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'https://api.launchpad.dev/people/admins'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Your value for the attribute 'teamowner_link' wasn't the URL to any
  object published by this web service.

Even a URL that identifies an object in the web service won't work, if
the object isn't the kind of object that can own a team:

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'http://api.launchpad.dev/bugs/1'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  Your value for the attribute 'teamowner_link' doesn't point to the
  right kind of object.

And even if the URL identifies the right kind of object, it might
violate some other constraint. For instance, a team can't be its own
owner.

  >>> admins['teamowner_link'] = u'http://api.launchpad.dev/~admins'
  >>> print modify_person('admins', admins, 'PUT')
  HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
  ...ERROR:  new row for relation "person" violates check constraint
  "no_loops"...


=== Date formats ===

Launchpad's web service serves and parses dates in ISO 8601
format. Only UTC dates are allowed.

The tests that follow make a number of PATCH requests that include
values for a person's 'datecreated' attribute.

  >>> salgado['datecreated']
  u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025+00:00'

  >>> def patch_salgado_datecreated(date):
  ...     "A helper method to try and change a date field."
  ...     return modify_person('salgado', {'datecreated' : date}, 'PATCH')

These requests aren't actually trying to modify 'datecreated', which
is read-only. They're asserting that 'datecreated' is a certain
value. If the assertion succeeds (because 'datecreated' does in fact
have that value), the response code is 200. If the assertion could not
be understood (because the date is in the wrong format), the response
code is 400, and the body is an error message about the date
format. If the assertion _fails_ (because 'datecreated' happens to be
read-only), the response code is also 400, but the error message talks
about an attempt to modify a read-only attribute.

The two 400 error codes below are caused by a failure to understand
the assertion. The string used in the assertion might not be a date.

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated('dummy')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You set the attribute 'datecreated' to a value that doesn't look
  like a date.

Or it might be a date that's not in UTC.

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T13:59:51.596025+05:00')
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  ...
  You set the attribute 'datecreated' to a time that's not UTC.

There are five ways to specify UTC:

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025Z')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025+00:00')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025+0000')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025-00:00')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025-0000')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

A value with a missing timezone is treated as UTC.

  >>> print patch_salgado_datecreated(u'2005-06-06T08:59:51.596025')
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
