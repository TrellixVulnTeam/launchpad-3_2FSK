Launchpad: The Vision
=====================

Introduction
============

Making a small computer program on one's own is easy.  It is much more
difficult to make open source software that is built by hundreds and fits
seamlessly into a complete platform running on someone else's hardware.  To do
so requires skill, planning and excellent tools.

What is Launchpad?
==================

Launchpad is a complete system for gathering changes from different types of
sources and collaboratively organizing them into packaged software for the end
user, delivered as part of an operating system that comes pre-installed on
purchased hardware.


Distinctives
------------

Launchpad is different from other "forges" in a few important ways:

  Cross-project collaboration
    No project lives in isolation.  Each project is part of an ecosystem of
    software.  Projects must be able to interact with each other, share bugs,
    teams, goals and code with each other.

  Front-end to open source
    Launchpad aims to be a front-end to open source.  Whether or not a project
    chooses to host on Launchpad, opportunistic developers can use Launchpad
    to navigate bugs, get code and send patches.  Likewise, we aim to present a
    uniform interface to the projects we have.

  Distributions are projects too
    Making a Linux distribution like Ubuntu is a massive endeavour that needs
    the support of the best tools.  Launchpad hosts Linux distributions in much
    the same way as it hosts projects, allowing for cross-project
    collaboration to

  Gated development
    Sometimes, secrets are necessary.  Launchpad understands that sometimes
    development needs to be done privately, and the results only later shared
    with the world.  Security fixes, OEM development for new hardware,
    proprietary services with open source clients are all examples of these.

  Hardware matters
    Many software developers like to pretend that hardware does not really
    exist.  When building an operating system, however, it matters a great
    deal.


Values
------

Invisible.  If not, fun.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launchpad is a tool to help busy people get important stuff done.  It should
stay out of the way where possible.  Bugs, OOPSes, downtime and slowness all
draw attention to Launchpad and away from the interesting problems that our
users are trying to solve.

Where it is not possible to stay out of the way, Launchpad should be fun to
use.  We make next actions obvious and draw attention to users' achievements.


Create and highlight opportunities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the grand things about open source software is that it is open to
contributions from total strangers.

Launchpad makes those contributions possible by removing as many barriers as
possible to contribution, and highlights areas where contributions would be
especially welcome.


XXX - Where communities intersect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Curtis goes on about this one.  I think he's on to something, but I don't
really know what it is or where it should go.


XXX - Collaboration occurs between people
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Something about the fact that "cross-project collaboration" is actually about
acknowledging that people are the entities that exist between projects.
