TeamParticipation
=================

The TeamParticipation table stores both direct and indirect members of a team.
More information can be found in the TeamParticipationUsage spec.

First of all, create some teams:

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamParticipationSet
>>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TeamSubscriptionPolicy
>>> teampart = TeamParticipationSet()
>>> policy = int(TeamSubscriptionPolicy.OPEN)
>>> p = Person.byName('name16')
>>> t1 = Person(subscriptionpolicy=policy, name='t1', teamowner=p)
>>> t2 = Person(subscriptionpolicy=policy, name='t2', teamowner=p)
>>> t3 = Person(subscriptionpolicy=policy, name='t3', teamowner=p)
>>> t4 = Person(subscriptionpolicy=policy, name='t4', teamowner=p)
>>> t5 = Person(subscriptionpolicy=policy, name='t5', teamowner=p)

We don't return results in any particular order, so we should define
a comparison function for the tests to use

>>> def tcmp(a,b):
...     return cmp(a.name,b.name)

Now, add p as a member of t3, ...

>>> p.joinTeam(t3)
True
>>> for m in teampart.getAllMembers(t3):
...     print m.name
name16

... t3 as a member of t2, ...

>>> t3.joinTeam(t2)
True
>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t2)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
name16
t3

... t2 as a member of t1, ...

>>> t2.joinTeam(t1)
True
>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t1)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
name16
t2
t3

... t2 as a member of t5, ...

>>> t2.joinTeam(t5)
True
>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t5)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
name16
t2
t3

... t5 as a member of t4

>>> t5.joinTeam(t4)
True
>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t4)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
name16
t2
t3
t5


Now let's remove some members to see what happens:

>>> p.unjoinTeam(t3)
True
>>> len(teampart.getAllMembers(t3))
0

>>> for m in teampart.getAllMembers(t2):
...     print m.name
t3

>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t4)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
t2
t3
t5

>>> l = teampart.getAllMembers(t5)
>>> l.sort(tcmp)
>>> for m in l:
...     print m.name
t2
t3

>>> t2.unjoinTeam(t5)
True
>>> for m in teampart.getAllMembers(t5):
...     print m.name

>>> for m in teampart.getAllMembers(t4):
...     print m.name
t5
