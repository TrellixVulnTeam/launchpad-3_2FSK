The service root (/[version]/) is a resource that responds to GET by
describing the web service. The description is in WADL format.

  >>> print webservice.get("/beta/")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  Content-Type: application/vd.sun.wadl+xml
  ...
  <application...>
  ...
  </application>

Though web services in general support all HTTP methods, this
particular resource supports only GET. Eventually it will also support
HEAD and OPTIONS.

  >>> for method in ['HEAD', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']:
  ...     print webservice("/beta/", method)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ...
