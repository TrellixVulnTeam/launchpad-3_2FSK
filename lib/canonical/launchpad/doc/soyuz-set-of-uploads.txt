Soyuz Set of Uploads Test
-------------------------

This test will:

  * Turn on the zeca keyserver
  * Run process-upload.py
  * Check result
  * Mark packages as ACCEPTED
  * Runs process-accepted.py
  * Check results
  * Cleanup


Uploading Packages
------------------


First, let's create a temporary directory where we'll put
uploaded files in.

  >>> import os
  >>> import tempfile
  >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
  >>> uploader_log = tempfile.mktemp()
  >>> incoming_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "incoming")
  >>> accepted_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "accepted")
  >>> rejected_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "rejected")
  >>> failed_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "failed")
  >>> os.mkdir(incoming_dir)


Processing Uploads
------------------

Before asking the system to process the upload, we must prepare the
database and services to receive it. Since we're using
'sample.person@canonical.com' as our Changed-By address and his
key has signed all the relevant uploads in the suite of uploads we're
using, this essentially boils down to ensuring that zeca and the
librarian are running and making sure that the key is attached to the
relevant launchpad person.

  >>> from canonical.zeca.ftests.harness import ZecaTestSetup
  >>> ZecaTestSetup().setUp()

Import public keyring into current LPDB.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

Having set up that infrastructure we need to prepare a breezy distrorelease
for the ubuntutest distribution.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Distribution
  >>> ut = Distribution.byName('ubuntutest')
  >>> ubuntu = Distribution.byName('ubuntu')
  >>> bat = ubuntu['breezy-autotest']
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import DistroReleaseSet
  >>> drs = DistroReleaseSet()
  >>> breezy = drs.new(ut, 'breezy', 'Breezy Badger', 'The Breezy Badger',
  ...                  'Black and White', 'Someone', '5.10', bat, bat.owner)
  >>> breezy_i386 = breezy.newArch('i386', bat['i386'].processorfamily,
  ...                              True, breezy.owner)
  >>> breezy.nominatedarchindep = breezy_i386
  >>> breezy.changeslist = 'breezy-changes@ubuntu.com'
  >>> breezy.initialiseFromParent()

Commit all that so that the scripts can see it.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Now that the infrastructure is ready, we prepare a set of useful methods.

Firstly, we need a way to copy a test upload into the queue

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.tests import datadir
  >>> def punt_upload_into_queue(leaf, distro):
  ...     inc_dir = os.path.join(incoming_dir, leaf, distro)
  ...     os.makedirs(inc_dir)
  ...     for file_leaf in os.listdir(datadir(os.path.join("suite", leaf))):
  ...         os.system("cp %s %s" %
  ...             (datadir(os.path.join("suite", leaf, file_leaf)), inc_dir))

We need a way to count the items in a queue directory

  >>> def count_items(queue):
  ...     return len(queue)

And then we need a way to process the uploads from the queue

  >>> from canonical.config import config
  >>> import subprocess, sys
  >>> def process_uploads(upload_policy, build_id, release):
  ...     # reset previous log content if it exists
  ...     if os.path.exists(uploader_log):
  ...         open(uploader_log, 'w').write('')
  ...     script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "process-upload.py")
  ...     args = [sys.executable, script, "--no-mails", "-v", "-C",
  ...             upload_policy]
  ...     if build_id is not None:
  ...         args.extend(["-b", build_id])
  ...     if release is not None:
  ...         args.extend(["-r", release])
  ...     args.extend([temp_dir, "--log-file", uploader_log])
  ...     process = subprocess.Popen(args)
  ...     return process.wait() == 0

And we need a way to process the accepted queue

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import PackageUploadStatus
  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login

  >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

  >>> def process_accepted(distro):
  ...     transaction.abort()
  ...     distribution = getUtility(IDistributionSet)[distro]
  ...     for release in distribution:
  ...         items = release.getQueueItems(
  ...            status=PackageUploadStatus.ACCEPTED)
  ...         for item in items:
  ...             item.realiseUpload()
  ...     flush_database_updates()
  ...     transaction.commit()

If an upload of ours ends up in the NEW queue, we need a way to process
it into the accepted queue

  >>> def process_new(distro, release):
  ...     transaction.abort()
  ...     distribution = getUtility(IDistributionSet)[distro]
  ...     if release is None:
  ...         release = "breezy"
  ...     dr, pocket = distribution.getDistroReleaseAndPocket(release)
  ...     items = dr.getQueueItems(status=PackageUploadStatus.NEW)
  ...     for item in items:
  ...         item.setAccepted()
  ...     items = dr.getQueueItems(status=PackageUploadStatus.UNAPPROVED)
  ...     for item in items:
  ...         item.setAccepted()
  ...     flush_database_updates()
  ...     transaction.commit()

Finally, as a very simplistic publishing process, we may need to punt any
given upload into the published state, so here's a very simplistic publisher

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory as SPPH,
  ...     BinaryPackagePublishingHistory as BPPH)
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import PackagePublishingStatus as PPS
  >>> from canonical.database.constants import nowUTC
  >>> def simple_publish(distro):
  ...     transaction.abort()
  ...     srcs_to_publish = SPPH.select("""
  ...         SourcePackagePublishingHistory.distrorelease = DistroRelease.id
  ...     AND DistroRelease.distribution = Distribution.id
  ...     AND Distribution.name = '%s'
  ...     AND SourcePackagePublishingHistory.status = 1""" % distro,
  ...         clauseTables=['DistroRelease', 'Distribution'])
  ...     bins_to_publish = BPPH.select("""
  ...         BinaryPackagePublishingHistory.distroarchrelease =
  ...             DistroArchRelease.id
  ...     AND DistroArchRelease.distrorelease = DistroRelease.id
  ...     AND DistroRelease.distribution = Distribution.id
  ...     AND Distribution.name = '%s'
  ...     AND BinaryPackagePublishingHistory.status = 1""" % distro,
  ...         clauseTables=['DistroArchRelease', 'DistroRelease',
  ...                       'Distribution'])
  ...     published_one = False
  ...     for src in srcs_to_publish:
  ...         sec_src = src.secure_record
  ...         sec_src.status = PPS.PUBLISHED
  ...         sec_src.datepublished = nowUTC
  ...         published_one = True
  ...     for bin in bins_to_publish:
  ...         sec_bin = bin.secure_record
  ...         sec_bin.status = PPS.PUBLISHED
  ...         sec_bin.datepublished = nowUTC
  ...         published_one = True
  ...     flush_database_updates()
  ...     transaction.commit()
  ...     return published_one

Now that we have all the structures we need in the form of the
functions punt_upload_into_queue, process_uploads, process_accepted,
process_new and simple_publish we are in a position to run the tests.

We can also define another helper function...

  >>> def expect_okays(leafname, is_new=False, upload_policy='anything',
  ...                  build_id=None, release=None, distro="ubuntutest"):
  ...     punt_upload_into_queue(leafname, distro=distro)
  ...     assert (process_uploads(upload_policy, build_id, release),
  ...             "Upload processes failed")
  ...     # There is always a lockfile in incoming...
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(incoming_dir)) == 1, "Incoming should be empty: %s" % os.listdir(incoming_dir)
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(rejected_dir)) == 0, "Rejected should be empty: %s" % os.listdir(rejected_dir)
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(failed_dir)) == 0, "Failed should be empty: %s" % os.listdir(failed_dir)
  ...     if is_new:
  ...         process_new(distro=distro, release=release)
  ...     process_accepted(distro=distro)
  ...     assert (simple_publish(distro=distro),
  ...             "Should publish at least one item")

The 'bar' package' is an arch-all package. We have four stages to the
bar test. Each stage should be simple enough. First we have a new
source, then a new binary, then an overridable source and then an
overridable binary. This tests the simple overriding of both sources
and arch-independant binaries.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-1', is_new=True)

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-1_binary', is_new=True)

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-2')

Check the rejection of bar_1.0-2_binary when uploaded to the wrong build id.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-2_binary', upload_policy="buildd",
  ...     build_id="2")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Rejected should be empty...

  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...
  ...Attempt to upload binaries specifying build 2, where they don't fit
  ...


Remove that failed upload.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(rejected_dir, 'bar_1.0-2_binary'))

...and try it again without the bogus build id.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-2_binary')

Check the rejection of a malicious version of bar package which refers
to a different 'bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz'.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-3')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Rejected should be empty...

Inspect the uploader log to find the rejection message.

  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()

  ...
  <BLANKLINE>

Remove rejected uploads.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(rejected_dir, 'bar_1.0-3'))

Check the rejection (instead of failure) of an upload to a release or
pocket which does not exist. We use the security upload policy for easier
testing, as unsigned uploads are allowed.

  >>> expect_okays('unstable_1.0-1', upload_policy="security")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Rejected should be empty...

  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()

  ...
  <BLANKLINE>

Remove rejected uploads.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(rejected_dir, 'unstable_1.0-1'))

Force weird behavior with rfc2047 sentences containing '.' on
bar_1.0-4, which caused bug # 41102.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> name16 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
  >>> name16.displayname = "Foo B. Bar"

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()

Check the email recipient for displayname containing special chars,
'.', must be rfc2047 compilant:

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-4')
  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...
  INFO       Subject: Accepted bar 1.0-4 (source)
  INFO       Recipients: "Foo B. Bar" <foo.bar@canonical.com>, Celso Providelo <celso.providelo@canonical.com>
  ...
  <BLANKLINE>

Revert changes:

  >>> name16.displayname = "Foo Bar"
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()

Check if we forcibly add the changer as recipient for "sync" uploads,
which contains unsigned changesfile. Ensure it sends email to the
changer and the distrorelease changes maillisting.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-5', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...

Add a new series of bar sourcepackage, rename its binary package to
'bar-bin', upload the binary and look for a spurious sourcepackagename
created with the binary package name.

  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-6', upload_policy='sync')
  >>> expect_okays('bar_1.0-6_binary', is_new=True)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISourcePackageNameSet
  >>> spn_set = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
  >>> assert spn_set.queryByName('bar-bin') is None


Check bahaviour of upload system for uploads to pocket BACKPORTS (see
bug #34089 and #58144)

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistributionReleaseStatus

Set ubuntutest/breezy as the "current release" to activate post-release
pockets.

  >>> breezy.releasestatus = DistributionReleaseStatus.CURRENT
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()

Update a version of source package "foo" to breezy-backports
(backports requires manual approval):

  >>> expect_okays('foo_2.9-1', upload_policy='sync', is_new=True)
  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...
  INFO    NEW: foo_2.9-1.dsc
  INFO     OK: foo_2.9.orig.tar.gz
  INFO     OK: foo_2.9-1.diff.gz
  ...

Since we have 2.9-1 as the current version in -backports, we should
not allow higher versions uploads to other pockets, so version 2.9-2
of foo target to -updates should be rejected:

  >>> expect_okays('foo_2.9-2', upload_policy='sync')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Rejected should be empty...

  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...
  INFO    Rejected:
  INFO    foo: Version newer than that in BACKPORTS. 2.9-2 >= 2.9-1
  ...
  INFO    Distribution: breezy-updates
  ...

  >>> shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(rejected_dir, 'foo_2.9-2'))

This new version of foo can only be uploaded to the -backports pocket itself:

  >>> expect_okays('foo_2.9-2', upload_policy='sync', is_new=True,
  ...              release='breezy-backports')
  >>> print open(uploader_log).read()
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  ...
  INFO    NEW: foo_2.9-2.dsc
  INFO     OK: foo_2.9-2.diff.gz
  ...

Set ubuntutest/breezy to 'experimental' state again to not affect the
rest of the test:

  >>> breezy.releasestatus = DistributionReleaseStatus.EXPERIMENTAL
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()


Perform a staged (source-first) security upload, simulating a run of
the buildd-queuebuilder inbetween, to verify fix for bug 53437. To be
allowed a security upload, we need to use a released distrorelease,
eg ubuntu/warty.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.section import (
  ...     Section, SectionSelection)
  >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
  >>> devel = Section.selectOneBy(name="devel")
  >>> ss = SectionSelection(distrorelease=warty, section=devel)
  >>> transaction.commit()

  >>> expect_okays('baz_1.0-1', is_new=True, upload_policy="security",
  ...     release="warty-security", distro="ubuntu")

Check there's a SourcePackageRelease with no build.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageRelease, SourcePackageName, Build)
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import (
  ...     BuildStatus, PackagePublishingPocket)
  >>> spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name="baz")
  >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  >>> spr_id = spr.id
  >>> builds = Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id)
  >>> len(list(builds))
  0

Manually create a build for this spr in i386, and commit so the script
can see it. This simulates the buildd-queuebuilder having run inbetween
the source and binary uploads.

  >>> warty_i386 = ubuntu['warty']['i386']
  >>> build = spr.createBuild(warty_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY,
  ...                         status=BuildStatus.NEEDSBUILD)
  >>> transaction.commit()

Check build created

  >>> len(list(Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id)))
  1

Upload the binary

  >>> expect_okays('baz_1.0-1_binary', is_new=True, upload_policy="security",
  ...     distro="ubuntu", release="warty-security")

Should still just have one build, and it should now be FULLYBUILT.

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import clear_current_connection_cache
  >>> clear_current_connection_cache()

  >>> builds = list(Build.selectBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr_id))
  >>> len(builds)
  1
  >>> builds[0].buildstate == BuildStatus.FULLYBUILT
  True


Regression test for bug 54039. Currently must be here, see bug 54158.

In bug 54039, we were rewriting all Release files, at a time when, in
unchanged pockets, the uncompressed Sources and Packages files would
be missing, having been deleted at the end of the previous publisher
run. Rewriting the Release files with these files missing produces a
broken distro.

We will make two publisher runs, deleting the uncompressed index files
inbetween, and verify that the second publisher run doesn't screw up the
release files in the way bug-54039 infected code would.

First a couple helpers.

  >>> import os
  >>> import stat
  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import sys
  >>> from canonical.config import config

  >>> def run_publish_distro(extra_args):
  ...     """Run publish-distro on ubuntutest with given extra args."""
  ...     script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "publish-distro.py")
  ...     args = [sys.executable, script, "-vv", "-d", "ubuntutest"]
  ...     args.extend(extra_args)
  ...     process = subprocess.Popen(args,
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  ...     stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  ...     return (process.returncode, stdout, stderr)

  >>> def release_file_has_uncompressed_packages(path):
  ...     """Return whether the release file includes uncompressed Packages."""
  ...     release_file = open(path)
  ...     release_contents = release_file.read()
  ...     release_file.close()
  ...     target_string = "Packages\n"
  ...     return release_contents.find(target_string) != -1


First publish the distro carefully, to get everything in place.

  >>> (result, stdout, stderr) = run_publish_distro(["-C"])
  >>> result
  0

Check the results:

  >>> print stderr
  INFO      Distribution: ubuntutest
  ...
  DEBUG   Added /var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/pool/main/b/bar/bar_1.0-2_i386.deb from library
  DEBUG   Added /var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/pool/main/b/bar/bar_1.0-1_i386.deb from library
  ...


Delete the uncompressed Packages and Sources files from the archive folder.
This simulates what cron.daily does between publishing runs.

  >>> os.system('find /var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest \\( -name "Packages" '
  ...           '-o -name "Sources" \\) -exec rm "{}" \\;')
  0

Record the timestamp of a release file we expect to be rewritten,
which we'll need later.

  >>> release_timestamp = os.stat('/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/'
  ...     'breezy/Release')[stat.ST_MTIME]

Re-publish the distribution, with careful publishing only. This will mean
only pockets into which we've done some publication will have apt-ftparchive
work done.

  >>> (result, stdout, stderr) = run_publish_distro(["-P"])
  >>> result
  0

Check the logging to ensure breezy-security was skipped. This ensures
changes to what's uploaded in the test above don't break the assumptions
of this test.

  >>> print stderr
  INFO      Distribution: ubuntutest
  ...
  DEBUG   /var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/pool/main/b/bar/bar_1.0-2_i386.deb is already in pool with the same content.
  ...
  DEBUG   Skipping a-f stanza for breezy/10
  ...
  DEBUG   Skipping release files for breezy/10
  ...

Check the breezy-security release file doesn't exhibit bug 54039.

  >>> release_file_has_uncompressed_packages(
  ...     '/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/breezy-security/Release')
  True

We also need to check the fix for bug 54039 didn't go too far, ie. that
Release files are still generated for those pockets where they should be.
So, check the MTIME has changed for hoary-test/Release.

  >>> new_release_timestamp = os.stat('/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/'
  ...     'breezy/Release')[stat.ST_MTIME]

  >>> new_release_timestamp == release_timestamp
  False



Nice! That's enough for now.. let's kill the process and clean
everything up.

  >>> shutil.rmtree("/var/tmp/archive/")
  >>> shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
  >>> os.remove(uploader_log)

  >>> ZecaTestSetup().tearDown()
