The Launchpad Ticket Tracker
============================

Launchpad has a "tech support request tracker" built in to it. So you can
have your community provide technical support using Launchpad for any
upstream application, or any distribution.

First, lets look at a product page. We should see the "Tickets" link, and we
should see an action item allowing us to "Request Support". We will look at
Firefox, and based on the sampledata we expect there to be three support
tickets.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../products/firefox/+tickets">Tickets...
  ...+addticket">Request Support...
  ...Latest Mozilla Firefox...Support Requests:...
  ...+ticket/4">Firefox loses focus and gets stuck...
  ...Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site...
  ...Firefox cannot render Bank Site...


On a distribution we also expect to see the Tickets link, and the ability to
request support.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/+tickets">Tickets...
  ...+addticket">Request Support...
  ...Latest...Support Requests:...


On a distrorelease we will see a "Request Support" link, but note that it
points at its distro, not itself. Support tickets are linked to distro, and
optionally source package too.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/+addticket">Request Support...

On a source package we should see the Tickets link, and a Request Support
link.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+tickets">Tickets...
  ...+addticket">Request Support...
  ...Latest...Support Requests:...

Let's make sure we can actually see the +tickets page on a Product.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/gnomebaker/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

And on a Distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

And on a Source Package.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/evolution/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Now, let's look at a ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
