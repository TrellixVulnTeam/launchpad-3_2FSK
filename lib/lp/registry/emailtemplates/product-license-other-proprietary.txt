Proprietary projects can use Launchpad by purchasing a commercial-use
subscription which costs US$250/year/project.  Follow the instructions
presented on your project overview page to purchase a subscription
voucher.

A commercial-use subscription allows you to host your commercial project
on Launchpad in the same manner as any other project. Project's with a
commercial-use subscription may have private-by-default bugs, and you
may also request the setup of private code hosting. As the maintainer of
a project with a commercial-use subscription, you may create private
teams with private mailing lists and private package archives.

If the license for your project needs to be corrected you can do so by
