        <h3>About the Launchpad Bug Tracker</h3>

        <p>Bugs aren't always found by the people who wrote the buggy code. If
           you find a bug in code that your project relies on, Launchpad helps
           you to create a cross-project team to solve it.
        <p>

        <p>If both projects use Launchpad's bug tracker, you can share common
           bugs. Shared bugs appear in both project's bug lists and send
           updates to both project's bug contacts but retain separate bug
           statuses.
         </p>

        <p>If your project is affected by a bug in code that is tracked by an
          external tracker - such as Bugzilla, Sourceforge or Debian BTS - you
          can ask Launchpad to report its current status on your project's bug
          page.
        </p>

        <p>Everyday bug reporting and management are simple, thanks to an
           intuitive web interface. Experience developers, many of whom prefer
           email to the web, are well served by a comprehensive email
           interface.
