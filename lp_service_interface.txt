Launchpad Codehosting Service Interface
=======================================

The codehosting service is a way to speed up the time it takes to spawn
many a new bzr smart-server for every codehosting connection.

Overview
========

The service starts up and preloads various libraries. It then opens up
a socket connection, where clients can make a few simple requests. One
of these is to fork a smart server process. The server then responds to
the client, indicating what FIFO handles they can use to communicate to
the new process.
