Calculating bug heat
====================

Launchpad bugs each have a 'hotness' rating. This is an indicator of how
problematic a given bug is to the community and can be used to determine
which bugs should be tackled first.

A new bug will have a hotness of zero.

    >>> from lp.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> bug = factory.makeBug()
    >>> bug.hotness
    0
