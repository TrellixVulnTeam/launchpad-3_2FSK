Distribution Source Packages
============================

A distribution source package represents a named source package in a
distribution, independant of any particular release of that source
package.

This is useful for, among other things, tracking bugs in source
packages, ensuring that bug reports automatically carry forward from one
distribution release to the next.

Fetching a Distribution Source Package
======================================

A common way to fetch a distribution source package is to start with the
distribution object:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IDistributionSourcePackage)

    >>> debian = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("debian")

Call IDistribution.getSourcePackage to get a specific package by name:

    >>> debian_firefox = debian.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")
    >>> debian_firefox.name
    u'mozilla-firefox'

Test more advanced features of IDistributionSourcePackage:

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("ubuntu")
    >>> dsp = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("pmount")
    >>> IDistributionSourcePackage.providedBy(dsp)
    True

Useful properties:

    >>> dsp.displayname
    u'pmount in ubuntu'

List of current 'pmount in Ubuntu' as ISourcePackage:

    >>> [(sp.name, sp.distrorelease.name) for sp in dsp.by_distroreleases]
    [(u'pmount', u'hoary')]

Publishing history of 'pmount in ubuntu':

    >>> dsp.publishing_history.count()
    2

Releases of 'pmount in ubuntu':

    >>> [release.version for release in dsp.releases]
    [u'0.1-2', u'0.1-1']

Binary packages of 'pmount in ubuntu':

    >>> dsp.binary_package_names
    u'pmount'

Current release of 'pmount in ubuntu':

    >>> dsp.currentrelease.version
    u'0.1-2'

Check if 'currentrelease' works with version containing letters
(bug # 6040):

    >>> dsp2 = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("alsa-utils")
    >>> dsp2.currentrelease.version
    u'1.0.9a-4ubuntu1'

    >>> dsp3 = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("cnews")
    >>> dsp3.currentrelease.version
    u'cr.g7-37'

Useful methods:

    >>> dsp.bugtasks().count()
    0

Retrieve a version of 'pmount in ubuntu' as a
IDistributionSourcePackageRelease or None if not found:

    >>> dsp.getVersion('1.0') is None
    True

    >>> dsp.getVersion('0.1-1').title
    u'pmount 0.1-1 (source) in ubuntu'


Package Bug Contact
===================

The package bug contact is zero, one or more people or teams that get
explicitly Cc'd to all public bugs filed on the package.

Distribution source packages don't have an associated database table
(i.e. there is no "DistributionSourcePackage" relation.) This
information is extrapolated from other tables. The package bug contacts
are obtained from looking at the PackageBugContact table.

The list of bug contacts associated with a package is accessed by the
IDistributionSourcePackage.bugcontacts attribute. When there are no
contacts associated with a package, an empty list is returned:

    >>> debian_firefox.bugcontacts
    []

Adding a package bug contact is done with the
IDistributionSourcePackage.addBugContact method. You have to be logged
in to call this method:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12)

    >>> debian_firefox.addBugContact(sample_person)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Let's login then to add a bugcontact:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> debian_firefox.addBugContact(sample_person)
    >>> [pbc.bugcontact.name for pbc in debian_firefox.bugcontacts]
    [u'name12']

Trying to add a bug contact to a package when that person or team is
already one of the bug contacts on that package will raise a
DuplicateBugContactError.

    >>> debian_firefox.addBugContact(sample_person)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DuplicateBugContactError: ...

Let's add an ITeam as one of the bug contacts:

    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(17)
    >>> debian_firefox.addBugContact(ubuntu_team)

    >>> sorted([pbc.bugcontact.name for pbc in debian_firefox.bugcontacts])
    [u'name12', u'ubuntu-team']

To remove a bug contact, use IDistributionSourcePackage.removeBugContact:

    >>> debian_firefox.removeBugContact(sample_person)
    >>> sorted([pbc.bugcontact.id for pbc in debian_firefox.bugcontacts])
    [17]

Trying to remove a bug contact that doesn't exist on a source package raises a
DeleteBugContactError.

    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(16)
    >>> print foobar.name
    name16
    >>> debian_firefox.removeBugContact(foobar)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DeleteBugContactError: ...

To find out if an IPerson or ITeam is bug contact, use
IDistributionSourcePackage.isBugContact. For pragmatic reasons (in particular,
it makes the implementation of some of IDistributionSourcePackage's other
methods simpler) IDistributionSourcePackage.isBugContact will return either the
appropriate PackageBugContact record or False:

    >>> debian_firefox.isBugContact(ubuntu_team)
    <PackageBugContact ...>
    >>> debian_firefox.isBugContact(foobar)
    False
