View bugs on Mozilla Firefox as the no-privs user:

  >>> print http(r"""

Note that the no-privs user doesn't have the permissions to see bug #11.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /firefox/+bug/11 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bm8tcHJpdkBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=

This is also true if no-privs tries to access the bug from another
context.
