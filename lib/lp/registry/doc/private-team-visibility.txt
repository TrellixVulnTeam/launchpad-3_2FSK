 Private team visibility
=========================

Private and private membership team restrict the visibility of their
attributes to select sets of users in order to prevent leaking
confidential data.

Private teams restrict the viewing of the membership list
to administrators and other members of the team.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonVisibility
    >>> priv_owner = factory.makePerson(name="priv-owner")
    >>> priv_member = factory.makePerson(name="priv-member")
    >>> login('commercial-member@canonical.com')
    >>> priv_team = factory.makeTeam(owner=priv_owner, name="priv-team",
    ...                              visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE)
    >>> login_person(priv_owner)
    >>> priv_team.addMember(priv_member, reviewer=priv_owner)

The team owner can see the membership.

    >>> members = priv_team.activemembers
    >>> for member in members:
    ...     print member.name
    priv-member
    priv-owner

A team member can access the membership.

    >>> login_person(priv_member)
    >>> members = priv_team.activemembers

A person who is not in the team cannot see the membership and cannot
see other details of the team, such as the name.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> members = priv_team.activemembers
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<Person at ... priv-team (Priv Team)>, 'activemembers', 'launchpad.View')

    >>> print priv_team.name
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<Person at ... priv-team (Priv Team)>, 'name', 'launchpad.View')

Public teams can join private teams.  When adding one team to another
the team is invited to join and that invitation must be accepted by
one of the invited team's admins.  Normally the admin of the invited
team is not a member of the private team and therefore cannot even see
the page to accept the invitation!  To resolve that situation the
rules for viewing a private team include admins of invited teams.

    >>> pub_owner = factory.makePerson(name="pub-owner")
    >>> pub_member = factory.makePerson(name="pub-member")
    >>> pub_team = factory.makeTeam(owner=pub_owner, name="pubteam")
    >>> login_person(pub_owner)
    >>> pub_team.addMember(pub_member, reviewer=pub_owner)

At this point the public team owner cannot see the priv-team's bits.

    >>> print priv_team.name
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<Person at ... priv-team (Priv Team)>, 'name', 'launchpad.View')

    >>> login_person(priv_owner)
    >>> priv_team.addMember(pub_team, reviewer=priv_owner)

The public team is not yet a member of the priv-team.

    >>> pub_team in priv_team.activemembers
    False
    >>> pub_owner in priv_team.activemembers
    False

The public team's owner can now see the priv-team's bits since his team
has been invited to join.

    >>> login_person(pub_owner)
    >>> print priv_team.name
    priv-team

But a non-admin member of the public team still cannot see anything
about the team.

    >>> login_person(pub_member)
    >>> print priv_team.name
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<Person at ... priv-team (Priv Team)>, 'name', 'launchpad.View')
