= TestTracXMLRPCTransport =

TestTracXMLRPCTransport is an XML-RPC transport which simulates the LP
Trac plugin. It can be used to avoid network traffic while testing, and
it implements the same API taht  Trac instances having the LP plugin
installed implement.

    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.externalbugtracker import (
    ...     TestTracXMLRPCTransport)
    >>> trac_transport = TestTracXMLRPCTransport()
    >>> server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    ...     'http://example.com/', transport=trac_transport)


== launchpad.bugtracker_version() ==

bugtracker_version() returns a list of
[Trac version, plugin version, dupe knowledge]. The version numbers are
returned as strings. `dupe_knowledge` indicates whether the Trac
instance knows how to track duplicate bugs.

    >>> server.launchpad.bugtracker_version()
    ['0.11.0', '1.0', False]


== launchpad.time_snapshot() ==

time_snapshot returns information about what the Trac instance thinks
the current time is. It returns the local time zone, the local time, and
the UTC time. The times are returned as seconds since epoch.

    >>> server.launchpad.time_snapshot()
    ['UTC', ..., ...]

It's possible to set which values will be returned, if the current time
isn't suitable.

    >>> trac_transport.seconds_since_epoch = 1206328061
    >>> trac_transport.local_timezone = 'US/Eastern'
    >>> trac_transport.utc_offset = -4*60*60

    >>> server.launchpad.time_snapshot()
    ['US/Eastern', 1206328061, 1206342461]
