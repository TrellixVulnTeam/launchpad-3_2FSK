  Change the owner of the mozilla firefox product.


  Logged in as no-priv@canonical.com we can't do that, because he's not the
  owner of the product nor a member of admins.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /projects/mozilla/firefox/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bm8tcHJpdkBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=

  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

  Now we're logged in as mark@hbd.com and he's the owner of the admins team,
  so he can do everything.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /projects/mozilla/firefox/+reassign HTTP/1.1

  Trying to change the owner to a new team with an invalid name is not
  allowed.

  >>> print http(r"""

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ... 
  ...'foo bar' is not a valid name for a team. Please make sure...
  ...


  Here he changes the owner to himself.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /projects/mozilla/firefox/+reassign HTTP/1.1

  Here we see the new owner: Mark Shuttleworth

  >>> print http(r"""
