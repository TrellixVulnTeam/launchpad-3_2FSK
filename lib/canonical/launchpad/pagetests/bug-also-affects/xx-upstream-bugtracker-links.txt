= Links to upstream bug trackers =

Sometimes people will want to mark a bug as being upstream but will
either not know what the bug's upstream URL is or will know that the bug
is not yet filed upstream.

If a  project is linked to an upstream bug tracker and there is a record
of the remote product it uses on that bug tracker, links will be shown
on the +choose-affected-product form to that bug tracker's bug filing
and search forms.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/13/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='+choose-affected-product').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Project').value = 'thunderbird'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

Thunderbird isn't linked to an upstream tracker, so the text is more
general.

    >>> text = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'upstream-text')
    >>> print extract_text(text)
    Mozilla Thunderbird doesn't use Launchpad to track its bugs. If you
    know this bug has been reported in another bug tracker, you can link
    to it; Launchpad will keep track of its status for you.

If we link Thunderbird to an upstream bug tracker, the text will change
to reflect this.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/thunderbird/+edit')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.bugtracker').value = ['external']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.bugtracker.bugtracker').value = ['1']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change').click()

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/13/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='+choose-affected-product').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Project').value = 'thunderbird'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> text = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'upstream-text')
    >>> print extract_text(text)
    Mozilla Thunderbird uses The Mozilla.org Bug Tracker to track its
    bugs. If you know this bug has been reported there, you can link to
    it; Launchpad will keep track of its status for you.

If the remote_product attribute of Thunderbird is set, links will be
displayed to the upstream bug tracker.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/13/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='+choose-affected-product').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Project').value = 'thunderbird'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> text = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'upstream-text')
    >>> print extract_text(text)
    Mozilla Thunderbird uses...
