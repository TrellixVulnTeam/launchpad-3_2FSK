= Products with no remote_product =

Product.remote_product is used to keep track of which product a Product
in Launchpad corresponds to in an upstream bug tracker. If a Product
doesn't have it set, but is associated with an upstream bug tracker, we
want to set this automatically. For this we need a method to get all the
Products needing updating.
IProductSet.getProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct() is used for this.


    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import (
    ...     IStoreSelector, DEFAULT_FLAVOR, MAIN_STORE)
    >>> store = getUtility(IStoreSelector).get(MAIN_STORE, DEFAULT_FLAVOR)
    >>> store.execute("UPDATE Product SET remote_product = 'not-None'")
    <storm...>
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> list(getUtility(IProductSet).getProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct())
    []

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name=u'no-remote-product')
    >>> print product.remote_product
    None

    >>> products = getUtility(IProductSet).getProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct()
    >>> [product.name for product in products]
    [u'no-remote-product']
