DistroReleaseLanguage
=====================

This is a special class which encapsulates the information associated with a
particular language and distrorelease.

First we need to know which distroreleaselanguage we are working with. We
will work with french in Hoary first.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistroReleaseSet, IDistributionSet, ILanguageSet)
    >>> distroreleaseset = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("ubuntu")
    >>> hoary = distroreleaseset.queryByName(ubuntu, "hoary")
    >>> hoary.name
    u'hoary'
    >>> french = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['fr']
    >>> hoary_french = hoary.getDistroReleaseLanguage(french)

Now lets get the list of real pofiles. By this we mean the ones where there
is actually a translation or two:

    >>> for po in hoary_french.pofiles: print po.potemplate.name
    pmount
    pkgconf-mozilla

Now lets include the dummies:

    >>> for po in hoary_french.po_files_or_dummies: print po.potemplate.name
    evolution-2.2
    pkgconf-mozilla
    pmount

Note that the sorting is by template name, and there is an evolution-2.2
dummy po file.
