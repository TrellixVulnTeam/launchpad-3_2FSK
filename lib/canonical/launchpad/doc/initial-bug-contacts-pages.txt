= Bug Contacts =

The list of teams that a user may add to a package as a bug contact will
only contain those teams of which the user is an administrator.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> package = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox')

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((package, request), name='+subscribe') 

Sample person is a member of two teams:

    >>> sample_person = view.user
    >>> ["%s: %s" % (membership.team.displayname, membership.status.name)
    ...  for membership in sample_person.myactivememberships]
    [u'Landscape Developers: ADMIN', u'Warty Security Team: APPROVED']

But is only an administrator of Landscape Developers, so that is the only
team that will be listed when the user is changing a package bug contact:

    >>> for team in view.user_teams:
    ...     print team.displayname
    Landscape Developers
