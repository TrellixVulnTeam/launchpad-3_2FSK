  Let's make sure that 'name16' is now an EXPIRED member of this team.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamMembership
  >>> foobar = Person.byName('name16')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> tm = TeamMembership.selectOneBy(personID=foobar.id, teamID=team.id)
  >>> tm.statusname
  'Expired'
  >>> foobar.inTeam(team)
  False
