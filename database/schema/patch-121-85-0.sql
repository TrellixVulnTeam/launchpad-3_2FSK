-- Create new PackageCopyRequest table.

-- Once an archive has been put into place the user will want to carry
-- out certain operations on it like e.g.

--   * copy packages to it; some workflows may well result in multiple copy
--     operations.
--   * cancel or resume builds given an archive/distroseries/component/pocket
--   * retry failed builds given an archive/distroseries/component/pocket

-- These archive level operations may take quite a bit of time and should
-- not be tied to a web GUI request because the latter is likely to time
-- out.

-- Instead the user will *specify* the operation he wants performed on an
-- archive along with any parameters needed. That will be picked up by a
-- service and performed in the background.

-- The GUI will facilitate the monitoring (progress) and manipulation
-- (cancellation) of these archive operations

-- For now we introduce the PackageCopyRequest since this is what we need to
-- get the rebuild archives and snapshots working.
