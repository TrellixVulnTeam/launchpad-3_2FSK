We should be able to see the workload of a sprint:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://localhost/sprints/ubz/+assignments')
  >>> anon_browser.title
  'Specification assignments for Ubuntu Below Zero'

We should be able to see the spec assignment table of a sprint:

  >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(anon_browser.contents)
  >>> [tag.string for tag in soup('tr')[0]('th')]
  ['Priority', 'Name', 'Definition', 'Delivery', 'Assignee', 'Drafter',
   'Approver']

And we should be able to see the workload page of a sprint even when there's
no spec assigned to people.

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://localhost/sprints/ltsponsteroids/+assignments')
  >>> 'No specifications to display' in anon_browser.contents
  True
