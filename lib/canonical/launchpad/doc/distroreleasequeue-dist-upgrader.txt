== DIST-UPGRADE upload ==

This test will check the upload of dist-upgrade tarballs

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IDistributionSet, IDistroReleaseSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUpload
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.uploadpolicy import findPolicyByName
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.tests import datadir

  >>> distro_release_set = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)
  >>> ubuntutest = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntutest']
  >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntutest['breezy-autotest']

  >>> import logging

  >>> class MockOptions:
  ...     distro = "ubuntutest"
  ...     distrorelease = None

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

Login as an admin.

  >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

First, test the rejection of a missapplied changesfile name:

  >>> upload = NascentUpload(
  ...     findPolicyByName('sync'), datadir('dist-upgrader'),
  ...     "dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes", logging.getLogger())
  >>> mock_options = MockOptions()
  >>> upload.policy.setOptions(mock_options)

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import UploadError
  >>> try:
  ...    upload.process()
  ... except UploadError, info:
  ...    print 'BOOM:', info
  BOOM: dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes -> missapplied changesfile name, should follow "<pkg>_<version>_<arch>.changes" format


Now do a proper upload into the system.

  >>> class MockLogger:
  ...     def debug(self, s):
  ...         print "DEBUG:", s
  ...     def error(self, s):
  ...         print "ERROR:", s

  >>> upload = NascentUpload(
  ...     findPolicyByName('insecure'), datadir('dist-upgrader'),
  ...     "dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes", MockLogger())


  >>> mock_options = MockOptions()
  >>> upload.policy.setOptions(mock_options)
  >>> upload.process()
  DEBUG: Beginning processing.
  DEBUG: Checking signature on changes file.
  DEBUG: Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes
  DEBUG: Verifying the changes file.
  DEBUG: Verifying files in upload.
  DEBUG: Single Custom Upload detected.
  DEBUG: Finding and applying overrides.
  DEBUG: Foo Bar (16) is an uploader for main.
  DEBUG: Finished checking upload.

It was not rejected.

  >>> upload.rejected
  False

  >>> success, msgs = upload.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Building recipients list.
  DEBUG: Adding recipient: 'Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>'
  DEBUG: Creating a New queue entry
  DEBUG: Setting it to ACCEPTED

And all things worked.

  >>> success
  True

  >>> print upload.rejection_message

We need to commit the transaction to be able to use the librarian files.
XXX: flush_database_updates() shouldn't be needed. This seems to be

  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()


Let's check how queue tool handles dist_upgrader uploads:

  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import os
  >>> import sys
  >>> from canonical.config import config

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools",
  ...                       "queue")


Rejecting item from accepted queue (very unlikely, normally it would
be rejecting from unapproved or new, fix bug #54649):

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-Q", "accepted",
  ...                             "-s", "breezy-autotest", "reject", "dist",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest", "-M"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stdout
  Initialising connection to queue accepted
  ...
  Rejecting dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz
  Would be sending a mail:
     Subject: dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes Rejected
     Sender: Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>
     Recipients: foo.bar@canonical.com
     Bcc: Root <root@localhost>
     Body:
  Rejected:
  dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz (http://localhost:58000/.../dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz) was REJECTED
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...


Accepting from rejected queue (ressurecting an reject upload is also
very unlikely, however it's only for testing purpose, fix #54649):

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-Q", "rejected",
  ...                             "-s", "breezy-autotest", "accept", "dist",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest", "-M"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stdout
  Initialising connection to queue rejected
  ...
  Accepting dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz
  Would be sending a mail:
     Subject: Accepted dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz - (raw-dist-upgrader)
     Sender: Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>
     Recipients: foo.bar@canonical.com
     Bcc: Root <root@localhost>, dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz_derivatives@packages.qa.debian.org
     Body:
  Accepted:
  dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz (http://localhost:58000/.../dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz) was ACCEPTED
  ...


Let's use the script to fetch the dist-upgrader upload:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-Q", "accepted",
  ...                             "-s", "breezy-autotest", "fetch", "dist",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stdout
  Initialising connection to queue accepted
  Running: "fetch dist"

Check if the files were written:

  >>> os.path.exists('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes')
  True
  >>> os.path.exists('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz')
  True

Cleanup the mess:

  >>> os.remove('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes')
  >>> os.remove('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz')


Inspect the QUEUE looking for an ACCEPTED entry corresponding to the
previous upload:

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistroReleaseQueueStatus
  >>> queue_item = breezy_autotest.getQueueItems(
  ...      status=DistroReleaseQueueStatus.ACCEPTED)[0]
  >>> queue_item.customfiles[0].libraryfilealias.filename
  u'dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz'

Do the publish, i.e process the CustomUpload writing the tarball in
the archive

  >>> queue_item.realiseUpload()

Check what was published in the target directory:

  >>> import os
  >>> archive_dir = '/var/tmp/archive/'
  >>> upgrade_dir = 'ubuntutest/dists/breezy-autotest/main/dist-upgrader-all'
  >>> target_dir = os.path.join(archive_dir, upgrade_dir)
  >>> content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
  >>> content
  ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Check the content of the directories published and the integrity of
the 'current' symbolic link.

  >>> real_path = os.path.join(target_dir, '20060302.0120')
  >>> current_path = os.path.join(target_dir, 'current')

  >>> os.path.islink(current_path)
  True

  >>> os.path.join(target_dir, os.readlink(current_path)) == real_path
  True

  >>> sorted(os.listdir(real_path))
  ['ReleaseAnouncement', 'dapper.tar.gz']


== Pre-publication version checks ==

Dist-Upgrader version is checked before installing any files in the
archive.

If any problem happen during the custom publication, the error will be
printed and the queue item will remain in ACCEPTED queue waiting for
manual intervention.

  >>> upload = NascentUpload(
  ...     findPolicyByName('insecure'), datadir('dist-upgrader'),
  ...     "dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.changes", MockLogger())

  >>> mock_options = MockOptions()
  >>> upload.policy.setOptions(mock_options)
  >>> upload.process()
  DEBUG: Beginning processing.
  DEBUG: Checking signature on changes file.
  DEBUG: Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.changes

  DEBUG: Single Custom Upload detected.

  DEBUG: Foo Bar (16) is an uploader for main.

  >>> success, msgs = upload.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Building recipients list.
  DEBUG: Adding recipient: 'Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>'
  DEBUG: Creating a New queue entry
  DEBUG: Setting it to ACCEPTED

Make the just-uploaded librarian file visible:

  >>> transaction.commit()

Check current archive status:

  >>> previous_content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
  >>> previous_content
  ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Publish the custom upload:

  >>> upload.queue_root.realiseUpload(MockLogger())
  DEBUG: Publishing custom dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.tar.gz to ubuntutest/breezy-autotest
  ERROR: Queue item ignored: bad version found in '.../dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.tar.gz': ('Bad upstream version format', 'foobar/foobar')

Check if the queue item remained in ACCEPTED and not cruft was
inserted in the archive:

  >>> upload.queue_root.status.name
  'ACCEPTED'

  >>> content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
  >>> content == previous_content
  True

Remove the directory to keep the test working.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(target_dir)
