    <h1>The Launchpad FAQ</h1>

    <!--
    * What is Launchpad?
    * Why is Launchpad important? Why is it different than other bug
      trackers or translation management systems?
    * Who are the users of Launchpad?
    * How are the components/subsystems of Launchpad related?
    * Launchpad sounds great and I want to use it!  Where do I start?
    * Why isn't Launchpad code open source?
    * Where can I report bugs about Launchpad itself, or request new
      features?
    * What happens if Launchpad, being non-free stuff, closes?
    * What's with the launchpad name?" (someone added this one to the RosettaFAQ)
    * What's the difference between a 'Team Admin', 'Team Member' and a 'Non-Member'?
    * Is the Rosetta code updated often?
    * Do I need a translation team?
    * Can I add my KikoLinux distro to Soyuz?

        <dt>How can I get in touch with the Launchpad team?</dt>

            <dd>
            The Launchpad team can be found on IRC on
            <code>irc.freenode.net</code>, on the <code>#launchpad</code>
            channel. The <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/launchpad-users">launchpad-users</a>
            mailing list is used for discussions.

        <dt>I visited a page and it crashed, giving me an OOPS code.
        What should I do?</dt>

            <dd>
            <p>
            OOPS codes are automatically registered and reported daily
            to the Launchpad developers; this class of bug is os highest
            priority to our team. There is no need to file a bug for an
            OOPS; our QA team ensures that all OOPSes have bugs
            registered for them (and you can <a href="https://launchpad.net/products/launchpad/+bugs-advanced?field.searchtext=&orderby=-priority%2C-severity&advanced=1&field.assignee=&field.unassigned.used=&field.include_dupes.used=&field.status%3Alist=Unconfirmed&field.status%3Alist=Needs+Info&field.status%3Alist=Confirmed&field.status%3Alist=In+Progress&field.status-empty-marker=1&field.severity-empty-marker=1&field.attachmenttype-empty-marker=1&field.milestone%3Alist=84&field.milestone-empty-marker=1&search=Search&field.milestone_assignment=&field.milestone_assignment-empty-marker=1">easily list them</a>).

            If you are unable to perform a certain task because of this
            crash, you are welcome to contact us through the means
            above; you may also <a

            </dd>

        <dt>Why do I need to have an account to report or comment on a bug?</dt>

            <dd>
            We require an account to access the Launchpad bug tracker
            based on the following rationale:
            <ul>
              <li>It makes it possible to contact the original reporter to
              request more information, offer him better support, and
              notify him when the bug he has filed is fixed.</li>
              <li>It also reduces the risk of comments and bugs being
              filed by spambots and other unattended agents.</li>
              <li>Creating a Launchpad account is straightforward;
              it only requires five minutes and an email address.</li>
            </ul>
            </dd>

        <dt>How do I sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct?</dt>

            <dd>
              You need to follow these steps, in order:

              <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0/"
                  >https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0/</a>
                </li>
                <li>Click on the "Download This Version" link and save it with
                  the name <em>ubuntu-coc.txt</em> in your home directory
                </li>
                <li>Open it with your favorite text editor and read it 
                  carefully
                </li>
                <li>Now, open a terminal and run the command 
                  <code>gpg --clearsign ~/ubuntu-coc.txt</code>.
                  (This will create a file named <em>ubuntu-coc.txt.asc</em>)
                </li>
                <li>Open the <em>ubuntu-coc.txt.asc</em> file with your favorite
                  text editor and copy all its contents
                </li>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0/+sign"
                  >https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0/+sign</a>,
                  paste that file's contents in that page and submit it
                </li>
              </ol>

            </dd>

        <dt>I have discovered I have two accounts registered in
        Launchpad. How did that happen, and how do I fix it?</dt>

            <dd>
            In certain situations Launchpad pre-creates people, based on
            email address, in its database:
            <ul>
              <li>If your email address is indicated in a source package
              imported into Launchpad; this includes all packages in
              Ubuntu.</li>
              <li>If you had an account in the Ubuntu Bugzilla bug
              tracker.</li>
              <li>If you were indicated as Last-Translator in a
              translation file included in Ubuntu or uploaded to
              Launchpad.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            These accounts are inactive, and their email address is not
            displayed anywhere in Launchpad. Launchpad only uses that
            information to satisfy referential integrity constraints in
            the database (and to allow us to credit you on the work you
            have done in the open source world!)
            </p>
            <p>
            If you encounter an account that belongs to you (an easy way
            to find out is <a
            href="https://launchpad.net/people/">searching Launchpad
            accounts</a> for your name or email addresses), claiming it
            is easy:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Log in to Launchpad using the account you would like
              to keep.</li>
              <li>Visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/people/+requestmerge">https://launchpad.net/people/+requestmerge</a>.</li>
              <li>Enter the name or email address of the duplicated account you
              discovered.</li>
              <li>A message will be sent to each email address
              registered for that account.  Follow the instructions in
              the confirmation message, and the merge will be complete.
              All information (translations, bugs, etc.) associated to
              that account will be transferred to your Launchpad
              account.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            If you no longer have access to an email address registered
            for your duplicate account, you can request a <a
            href="https://launchpad.net/people/admins">Launchpad
            administrator</a> for assistance in merging your accounts.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>I signed up, but Launchpad didn't send me email! What's up?</dt>
            <dd>
            There are a few situations in which you may fail to receive
            the account confirmation email:
            <ul>
              <li>Your mail server rejects email from Launchpad.</li>
              <li>Your mail server <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting">greylists</a>
              email from Launchpad.</li>
              <li>Launchpad's sending of mail is broken.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            There are a few reasons why your server might reject email
            from Launchpad. The most common is the use of a block list
            that includes our outgoing mail server's address; while we
            ensure we never send out unsolicited email, block lists are
            independently operated and may intentionally or not include
            legitimate servers. Another reason is an incorrectly
            configured email server. A suggestion to identify and work
            around this type of problem is to sign up to Launchpad using
            a different email account: <a
            href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, <a
            href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Mail</a> and <a
            href="http://www.hotmail.com/">MSN Hotmail</a> are all known
            to accept email from Launchpad.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the case of greylisting, email is normally only delayed,
            and eventually it will be delivered to you -- the delay is a
            nuisance, but it is an intrinsic consequence of the use of this
            spam-avoidance technique.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the past, there have been cases in which the Launchpad
            server would fail to send outgoing email. We monitor such
            cases carefully, and when they occur, the problem is usually
            fixed quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
            In any case, please contact us (using the means described
            above) if you feel we are failing to send you email.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>Who gets emailed when I upload a source package to Launchpad?</dt>
            <dd>
            It depends. Launchpad sends out two emails in the most common
            case, which is that of:
            <ul>
              <li>a package being uploaded to the release pocket of a
              release which is open for development</li>
              <li>an upload which passes all of required tests</li>
              <li>an upload which does not need intervention from the distribution
            managers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Of those two emails,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first is sent to the distribution release's
              changes list.</li>
              <li>The second is sent to people associated with the
              changes file. The people considered are:
              <ul>
                <li>the signer of the changes file;</li>
                <li>the person listed in the Maintainer field;</li>
                <li>the person listed in the Changed-By field.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              If a selected email address is associated to a Launchpad
              account that is a member of a team permitted to upload to
              the distribution (ubuntu-core-dev for Ubuntu, for
              example), it will receive a notification of the upload.
              </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </dd>

        <dt>Is Launchpad open source? Will it be?</dt>

            <dd>
            <p>
            Our goal is to release all of Launchpad as free software, though it
            will take some time (potentially, years) before that happens.
            </p><p>
            We are doing so in a piecemeal approach. Parts of Launchpad have already
            been released as free software where they would be particularly useful to
            other projects. And very few, if any, Launchpad modifications to upstream
            code are not immediately published to those upstream projects.
            </p><p>
            Launchpad is a large, monolithic, web application. We would
            be happy to release the code for the Registry, for example,
            which keeps track of all upstream products and their series
            and releases; however, that code will not run without the
            distribution management code, which is part of of the
            service that Canonical provides to other companies that make
            their own distributions.
            </p><p>
            If you are keen on seeing Launchpad components published as
            free software sooner, rather than later, and you have good
            Python and Zope3 skills, we are happy to provide code access
            and accept patches that use Zope 3's component architecture
            to factor out individual Launchpad applications and make it
            easier to release chunks of Launchpad.  That is a lot of
            hard work, but it would make it possible to release the
            Registry, and the parts of Rosetta that are used for
            upstream translation.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>Launchpad is down for maintenance.  How long before it comes back?</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>
            Normally, Launchpad is updated every Tuesday, generally
            around 10:00 UTC. This normally results in 30 minutes of
            downtime as the production servers are upgraded.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are other -- exceptional -- situations in which
            Launchpad may become unavailable. When it is a planned
            outage, email is sent to the <a
            href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/launchpad-users">Launchpad
            users mailing list</a> notifying when, and how long.
            Unpredictable outages are unfortunately, well,
            unpredictable; however, the servers are maintained by a
            dedicated team that is very responsive, and downtime is
            normally minimal.
            </p>
            </dd>

        <dt>Can I translate Launchpad itself into my language?</dt>
            <dd>
            You can't, yet. Launchpad is still in the process of having
            its templates assembled and published, and the
            infrastructure for serving different languages is not yet
            ready. When this happens, we'll be sure to make a public
            announcement and invite community translators.
