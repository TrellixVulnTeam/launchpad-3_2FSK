Poll Pages
==========

Test some poll-related pages.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility, getView
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPollSet, IPersonSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

  >>> login("test@canonical.com")

  >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(17)
  >>> poll = getUtility(IPollSet).getByTeamAndName(ubuntu_team, 'director-2004')
  >>> poll.type.title
  'Condorcet Voting'

Although condorcet polls are disabled now, everything is implemented and we're
using a pairwise matrix to display the results. It's very trick to create this
matrix on page templates, so the view provides a method wich return this
matrix as a python list, with the necessary headers (the option's names).

  >>> poll_results = getView(poll, "+index", TestRequest())
  >>> for row in poll_results.getPairwiseMatrixWithHeaders():
  ...     print row
  [None, u'A', u'B', u'C', u'D']
  [u'A', None, 2L, 2L, 2L]
  [u'B', 2L, None, 2L, 2L]
  [u'C', 1L, 1L, None, 1L]
  [u'D', 2L, 1L, 2L, None]
