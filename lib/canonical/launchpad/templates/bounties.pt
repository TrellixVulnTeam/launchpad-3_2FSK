        Below are all of the outstanding bounties. You can change the sort
        order by clicking on the column on which you want to sort. You can
        stake a claim to any unclaimed bounty, but must then begin to
        deliver code on a regular schedule, or forfeit the claim to someone
        else. The reviewer will decide when the submission is complete, and
        can also rule that a claimant is making no progress, which will make
        the bounty available again. Payments will be made by Paypal, wire
        transfer can also be made for bounties in excess of $500.
