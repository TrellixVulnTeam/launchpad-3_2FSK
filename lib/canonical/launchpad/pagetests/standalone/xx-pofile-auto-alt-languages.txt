The system should automatically select an alternative language for you if
you are translating in a language where there is an obvious common
alternative language. In general, if your language code is of the form xx_YY
then you will get 'xx' as your default alternate language.

We'll start by showing the translation page for Spanish (Mexican), which
should have the Spanish language selected as its alternate, by default.

  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...<select name="alt" title="Make suggestions from...
  <option value="es" selected="yes">Spanish</option>
  ...

There are some exceptions. pt_BR is quite independent of pt, so we should
not show pt by default for pt_BR translators:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+series/main/+pots/evolution-2.2/pt_BR/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...<select name="alt" title="Make suggestions from...
  ...
  <option value="pt">Portuguese</option>
  ...

Of course, we als would not show an alternate language for something like
French!

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/evolution/+series/main/+pots/evolution-2.2/fr/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==

  <option value="" selected="yes"></option>
