On a team home page, we show up to the latest five members who were approved
as well as the up to five latest members who proposed themselves.

    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('name18')
    >>> team_home = create_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> membershipset = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet)
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    ...            
    name20: Approved
    spiv: Approved
    limi: Approved

    >>> for member in team_home.recently_proposed_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)

If new members are added/proposed, they'll show up at the top of the lists.

    >>> sample_person = personset.getByName('name12')
    >>> sample_person.join(ubuntu_team)
    >>> salgado = personset.getByName('salgado')
    >>> sabdfl = personset.getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(salgado, reviewer=sabdfl)

    >>> team_home = create_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    salgado: Approved
