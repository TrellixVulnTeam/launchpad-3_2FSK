    <h1>Reviewing translations</h1>

    <p>
      As a member of one or more translation groups, you can help make
      sure that that the work of other translators makes it into
      published software.
    </p>

    <p>
      All you need to do is review a few translated strings, every now
      and then, in the languages with which you're familiar. The more
      reviews you do, the more software will be available in the
      languages you care about.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get started, simply follow the review links on your
      <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/people/+me/" target="_blank">
      translation dashboard</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> you should be familiar with the
      overall guidelines set by the translation group, and any specific
      to that language, before you start reviewing. Take a look at the
      <a href="/+groups/" target="_blank">translation group overview
      page</a> for links to the guidelines.
