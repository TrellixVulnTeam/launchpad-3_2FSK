Arch Changesets
===============

The Changeset table holds information about an Arch Changeset, with
reference to the Arch Branch that it is on.

We need to represent this as an Arch "package" string suitable for
the command-line tool.  So we provide a function to do that.

We can get a Changeset object in the normal way:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.archchangeset import Changeset
    >>> changeset = Changeset.get(3)

Calling getPackageName() should yield the full string:

    >>> print changeset.getPackageName()
    mozilla@arch.ubuntu.com/mozilla--release--0.9--base-0
