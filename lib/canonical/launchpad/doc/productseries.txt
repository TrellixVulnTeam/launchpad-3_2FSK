ProductSeries
=============

A "release series" or "branch" is a sequence of releases that are mostly the same codebase, with just minor changes between them. 


ProductSeriesSourceSet implements two methods to search the database for
IProductSeries that have RCS details set. It returns an IProductSeries or
None.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSeriesSourceSet

>>> cvsroot = ':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'
>>> cvsmodule = 'evolution'
>>> cvsbranch = 'MAIN'
>>> svnrepository = 'svn://testing.com'
>>> productseriesset = getUtility(IProductSeriesSourceSet)
>>> productseries = productseriesset.getByCVSDetails(cvsroot, cvsmodule,
...     cvsbranch)
>>> productseries.name
u'main'

>>> productseries = productseriesset.getBySVNDetails(svnrepository)
>>> print productseries
None
