Person Pages
------------

There are several person pages in Launchpad. Many of them are driven
by the PersonView view class.

+assignedbugs
-------------

The +assignedbugs shows bugs relevant to the currently logged in
user. There are various view methods used to render this page. To
demonstrate this, let's start by grabbing the +assignedbugs view
object on a person:

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility, getView
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

  >>> login("test@canonical.com")

  >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12)
  >>> assignedbugs_view = getView(sample_person, "+assignedbugs", TestRequest())

The assigned bugs report shows bug tasks directly assigned to this
person:

  >>> tasks = assignedbugs_view.bugTasksAssignedToPerson()
  >>> task_ids = sorted([task.id for task in tasks])
  >>> task_ids
  [5, 14]

Additionally, it shows bug tasks assigned to this person by way of
team participation:

  >>> tasks = list(assignedbugs_view.bugTasksOnMaintainedSoftware())
  >>> task_ids = sorted([task.id for task in tasks])
  >>> task_ids
  [2, 13, 14, 15]

Finally, when a user views the +assignedbugs page of another user, the
bugs for which the current user and the displayed user share a common
interest are also shown. "Common interest" is defined as when both
users are members of the maintainer team or when one user is the
maintainer and the other is directly assigned to fix the task.

XXX: Brad Bollenbach, 2005-09-06: This method
(.bugTasksWithSharedInterest) needs tests but it's non-trivial to
write them and I have a critical bug to fix in the meantime. I've got
kiko's blessing to leave this method untested for now.
