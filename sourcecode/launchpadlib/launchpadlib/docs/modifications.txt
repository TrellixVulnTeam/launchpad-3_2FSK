Objects available through the web interface, such as people, have a readable
interface which is available through direct attribute access.

    >>> from launchpadlib.testing.helpers import Launchpad
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(Launchpad.tokens.salgado_change_anything)

    >>> salgado = launchpad.people.get('salgado')
    >>> salgado.display_name
    u'Guilherme Salgado'

Some of these attributes can be changed.  For example, a person can change his
or her display name.  When changing attribute values though, the changes are
not pushed to the web service until the object is explicitly saved.  This
allows us to batch the changes over the wire for efficiency.

    >>> salgado.display_name = u'Salgado'
    >>> launchpad.people.get('salgado').display_name
    u'Guilherme Salgado'

Once the changes are saved though, they are saved on the web service.

    >>> salgado.save()
    >>> launchpad.people.get('salgado').display_name
    u'Salgado'

The person object is a normal Python object like any other.  You can set any
attribute on the object, but if it doesn't correspond to a web services
object, it won't be persistent.

    >>> salgado.display_name = u'Guilherme Salgado'
    >>> salgado.is_great = True
    >>> salgado.save()
    >>> salgado = launchpad.people.get('salgado')
    >>> salgado.display_name
    u'Guilherme Salgado'
    >>> salgado.is_great
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: is_great
