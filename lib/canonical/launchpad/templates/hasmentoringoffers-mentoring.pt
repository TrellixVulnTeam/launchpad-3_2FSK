  Launchpad lets you keep track of offers of mentorship from members of your
  community. Anybody who is a member of a team can offer to mentor work on a
  bug, or a blueprint. Launchpad then keeps track of those offers, and you
  can use its listings as a convenient starting place for new contributors.
  Read the
  <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/MentoringManagement/">documentation</a>
  for more detailed information.

    You can <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/MentoringManagement">learn
    more about this capability in Launchpad</a>, which allows you to
    create an "onramp" of
    bite-sized chunks of work for new people who want to contribute or to
    prove their worth.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, you can encourage members of your teams to offer mentoring
    on bugs and blueprints that they know how to fix or implement, but which
    they don't have time to get to personally. This list then makes a good
    starting point for new community members who want to make a contribution
    but don't know where to start.
