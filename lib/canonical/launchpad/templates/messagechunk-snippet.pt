        This block used to display attachments as a link to the Librarian.
        This is currently disabled until we determine how to handle them.
        In particular, it is currently specified that we will accept
        comments from unknown users via email, but this could allow
        Malone to be used to distribute porn.

        TODO: We probably need to simply bounce emails with attachments from
        unknown users and turn this back on. -- StuartBishop 20050203
