Some standard behavior is defined by the web service itself, not by
the individual resources.

== Nonexistent resources ==

An attempt to access a nonexistent resource yields a 404 error.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /no-such-resource HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...

== Nonexistent methods ==

An attempt to use an unsupported or nonexistent HTTP method on a
resource yields a 405 error.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... COPY / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET HEAD POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS
  ...
