"""Test Translation Message Sharing schema initializations.

This script verifies the results of the message-sharing-populate.py
one-off script.  It checks that all schema elements that were added for
translation message sharing were initialized correctly.

Run this after message-sharing-populate.py, but also occasionally
afterwards to ensure that the code that initializes the added schema
elements on new data is working correctly.

The new schema elements are not used yet.  Once they are, a next step is
to start unifying TranslationMessages that are common between
POTemplates.  When that happens, this script will start reporting errors
at points marked in the source below.  Change those points & run again!
