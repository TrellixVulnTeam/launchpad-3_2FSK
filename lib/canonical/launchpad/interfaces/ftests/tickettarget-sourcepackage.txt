= ITicketTarget for SourcePackage =

The ITicketTarget implementation contain one some small differences with
the other ones. (See tickettarget.txt for the generic interface
description.)

The target attribute of tickets created on SourcePackage will be
that of the distribution (and not the SourcePackage):

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IPersonSet, IDistributionSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> firefox = ubuntu.currentrelease.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox')

    >>> ticket = firefox.getTicket(3)
    >>> ticket.target == firefox
    False
    >>> ticket.target == ubuntu
    True

This special case is also present on the ITicketTarget implementation
for DistributionSourcePackage.

    >>> evolution = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('evolution')
    >>> ticket.target == evolution
    False
    >>> ticket.target == ubuntu
    True
