XXX: One day, someone needs to fill this out with more interesting tests
then the simple one I'm adding today.

>>> from zope.component import getUtility
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (IProjectSet, IProject,
...                                             NotFoundError)
>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
>>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login

Grab the gnome project from its project set:

>>> projectset = getUtility(IProjectSet)
>>> gnome = projectset["gnome"]

Set it as inactive, logging in as an admin:

>>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
>>> gnome.active = False
>>> flush_database_updates()

It had better not show up any longer!

>>> try:
...   projectset[gnome.name]
... except NotFoundError:
...   pass

But it should be shown using the getByName()

>>> projectset.getByName('gnome').name
u'gnome'

getByName() also accepts an argument to ignore inactive projects. 

>>> print projectset.getByName('gnome', ignore_inactive=True)
None
