    <h1>What is karma?</h1>

    <p>
      Karma is one of the ways in which you can get a feel for the work 
      that someone has done recently in Launchpad.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Almost everything you do in Launchpad helps you to build karma. For 
      example: registering bugs, translating strings and answering support 
      requests. Different types of work earn different levels of karma. 
      Also, the amount of karma a particular action gives you fades over 
      time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Karma is only attributed for work done in Launchpad and does not 
      apply to items imported from other sources.
