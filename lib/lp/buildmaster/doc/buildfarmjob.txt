BuildFarmJob
============

    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.buildfarmjob import IBuildFarmJob
    >>> from lp.buildmaster.model.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     BuildFarmJob, BuildFarmJobDerived)

BuildFarmJob provides a basic implementation of IBuildFarmJob.  The
specific build farm job classes will automatically delegate to
BuildFarmJob by inheriting BuildFarmJobDerived.

    >>> buildfarmjob = BuildFarmJob()
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJob, buildfarmjob)
    True

The BuildFarmJob class does not (yet) do a lot itself, other than
providing default implementations for its methods.

    >>> print buildfarmjob.getLogFileName()
    buildlog.txt

    >>> buildfarmjob.getName()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError


BuildFarmJobDerived
===================

BuildFarmJobDerived exists to encapsulate the functionality required
by classes delegating IBuildFarmJob.

    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     IBuildFarmJobDerived)
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJobDerived, BuildFarmJobDerived())
    True

This class also includes the getByJob() class method used to find the
instance of a specific build-farm job implementation associated with a
given Job instance which must be called in the context of a concrete
derived class. See lp.buildmaster.tests.test_buildqueue for examples.
