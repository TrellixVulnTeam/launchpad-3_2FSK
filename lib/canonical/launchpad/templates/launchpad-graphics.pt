  <p class="documentDescription">
    A summary of the icons and graphics used in Launchpad, what sizes they
    occur in, and what they mean.
  </p>

  <h2>Icon naming</h2>

  <p>
    We need a systematic and consistent way to name icons. At the moment, we
    just put whatever the name of the first icon we picked was straight into
    the templates. <b>Proposal:</b> we should use a name structure like
    "add_large", "add_small" and "add" to indicate the icons for "adding",
    with no reference to the file type (so, not "add.png") or size. Perhaps
    we should have "add_scalable" or "add_svg" to indicate scalable images.
  </p>

  <h2>System icons</h2>

  <p>
    These icons are used throughout the system, in all applications, and
    have the specific meaning defined here.
  </p>

  <h2>Application graphics</h2>

  <p>
    These are images that represent one of the Launchpad applications, for
    example the bug tracker (codename "Malone") or the translation system
    (code name "Rosetta"). The large version of these images will be used on
    the landing pages for those applications (bugs.launchpad.net or
    features.launchpad.net), and may also be used on the overall Launchpad
    home page (launchpad.net).
  </p>

  <h3>Malone, the bug tracker</h3>

  <p>
    <img src="/@@/malone" align="left" />Malone is the bug tracking engine
    in Launchpad. It enables projects to track their bugs and also to
    collaborate with other people using their code on the fixes for those
    bugs.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Rosetta, the translation engine</h3>
  
  <p>
    <img src="/@@/rosetta" align="left" />Rosetta is the Launchpad
    translation engine. It allows projects to invite translators to help make
    their software work in any written language. Translators contribute new
    translations over the web which are then included in new releases of the
    software.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Blueprint, the feature tracking application</h3>
  
  <p>
    <img src="/@@/blueprint" align="left" />Blueprint is the Launchpad
    feature tracker. It is used to help projects plan their feature
    development and coordinate across distributed teams.
  </p>

  <h3>Greenhouse, the code management system</h3>
  
  <p>
    <img src="/@@/greenhouse" align="left" />"Greenhouse" (alert, alert,
    working title in use :-)) is the name of the Launchpad application which
    keeps track of the source code for a particular object in Launchpad.

  <h3>Soyuz, the distribution package management system</h3>
  
  <p>
    <img src="/@@/soyuz" align="left" />Soyuz is the Launchpad subsystem
    that keeps track of the packages in a distribution. It handles uploads,
    the checking of permissions and consistency, builds, and the publishing
    of these packages into an archive.

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>architecture</td>
        <td><img src="/@@/architecture" /></td>
