    <h1>About DOAP</h1>

    <p>Based on Edd Dumbill's DOAP framework for open source project
    descriptions, this system allows us to keep track of all the open source
    projects and products that ultimately are packaged in Ubuntu and its
    derivatives, or translated in Rosetta, or have bugs tracked by Malone.</p>

    <p>Each open source product includes a description of the product, and
    links to translations, bugs, bazaar branches of the code itself and
    packages in Ubuntu.</p>
