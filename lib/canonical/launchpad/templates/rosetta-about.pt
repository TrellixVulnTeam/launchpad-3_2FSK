  <h1>About Rosetta</h1>

    <p>Rosetta is a web tool for translating any open source software into
    any language. The ultimate goal of the Rosetta Project is to ensure that
    every piece of open source software is usable in every language. We
    invite you to find the open source software you use the most, and help
    to translate it into your own native language, if it is not already
    completely translated. All you need is a web browser, a good knowledge
    of the application you are translating, and a knowledge of English.</p>

    <h2>Join the Rosetta Translators Community</h2>

    <p>To participate in the development and testing of Rosetta please join
    the <a
    href="http://lists.ubuntulinux.org/mailman/listinfo/rosetta-users">Rosetta
    users mailing list</a>, where we discuss new features, bugs and other
    issues related to the Rosetta Project.</p>

    <h2>Adding projects to Rosetta</h2>

    <p>It's easy to add a new project to be translated in Rosetta. First you
    need to add the product to the Launchpad registry. You can seach for
    existing registered open source products <a href="/products/">here</a>,
    and then add yours if it's not already listed. Once the product is
    registered in the Launchpad, you can email the Rosetta mailing list (see
    address above) and ask the Rosetta admins to import the usptream
    translation templates and resource files - then you are ready to
    translate.</p>
