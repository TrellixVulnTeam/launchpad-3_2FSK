  <h1>Claim account</h1>

  <p class="error message">
    XXX: Should we include the context/creation_rationale here?</p>

  <p>
  Launchpad accounts can be created automatically if we find a name and
  e-mail address in an imported bug report, source code branch, or package
  manifest, or if you create an account on a related site.
  </p>

  <p>
  If this looks like you, relax! You don't need to do anything, and we'll
  never spam you. But claiming your account will let you edit your contact
  details, register your own products and code branches in Launchpad, and
  take advantage of the powerful Launchpad applications. To claim the
  account, enter one of the e-mail addresses this account is associated
  with. (We're not showing you the list of addresses to protect your privacy.)
