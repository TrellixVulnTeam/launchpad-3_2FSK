%(actor_browsername)s has updated your location and time zone information in
Launchpad. This lets us present dates and times in your local time, and
helps to coordinate team events that will span multiple time zones.

Your information can be updated (wiki-style) by any other user until
you provide definitive data yourself, at which point the information is
locked so that only you can edit it.

Your details (now with map!): https://launchpad.net/~%(person)s
%(actor_browsername)s's details: https://launchpad.net/~%(actor)s

You can edit the location and time zone information for yourself at:
