= Hidden by configuration variable =

XXX: We don't want to expose the web service until it's ready, so
there's a config variable which controls its visibility. This test
will go away when we decide to deploy the web service on
production. -- Leonard Richardson 2008-01-04

Also, this probably won't be a page test once it's done.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.webservice.exposed
    True

When the web service is exposed, the web service publication factory
handles requests.

    >>> # ...

When the web service is not exposed, it doesn't.

    >>> config.webservice.exposed = False
    >>> # ...
