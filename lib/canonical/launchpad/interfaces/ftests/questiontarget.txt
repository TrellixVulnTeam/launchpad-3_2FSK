= IQuestionTarget Interface =

Launchpad includes an answer tracker. Questions are associated to
objects implementing IQuestionTarget. This file documents that interface
and can be used to validate implementation of this interface on a
particular object. (This object is made available through the 'target'
variable which is defined outside of this file, usually by a
LaunchpadFunctionalTestCase. This instance shouldn't have any questions
associated with it at the start of the test.)

    # Some parts of the IQuestionTarget interface are only accessible
    # to a registered user.
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IQuestionTarget

    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, target)
    True

== newQuestion() ==

Questions are always owned by a registered user.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail(
    ...     'test@canonical.com')

The newQuestion() method is used to create question that will be associated
with the target. It takes as parameters the question's owner, title and
description. It also takes an optional parameter 'datecreated' parameter
which defaults to UTC_NOW.

    # Let's define now to a know value.
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> now = datetime.now(UTC)

    >>> question = target.newQuestion(sample_person, 'New question',
    ...     'Question description', datecreated=now)
    >>> print question.title
    New question
    >>> print question.description
    Question description
    >>> question.owner == sample_person
    True
    >>> question.datecreated == now
    True
    >>> question.datelastquery == now
    True

The created question starts in the 'Open' status and should have the owner
subscribed to the question.

    >>> question.status.title
    'Open'

    >>> sample_person in [s.person for s in question.subscriptions]
    True

Question can be written in any languages supported in Launchpad. The
language of the request is available in the 'language' attribute. By
default, requests are assumed to be written in English:

    >>> print question.language.code
    en

It is possible to create question in another language than English. One
just need to pass the language in which the question is written in the
language parameter.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> french = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['fr']
    >>> question = target.newQuestion(sample_person, "De l'aide S.V.P.",
    ...     "Pouvez-vous m'aider?", language=french,
    ...     datecreated=now + timedelta(seconds=30))
    >>> print question.language.code
    fr

Anonymous users cannot use newQuestion():

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> question = target.newQuestion(sample_person, 'This will fail',
    ...     'Failed?')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized...

== getQuestion() ==

The getQuestion() method is used to retrieve a question by id for a
particular target.

    >>> target.getQuestion(question.id) == question
    True

If you pass in a non-existent id or a question for a different target, the
method must return None.

    >>> target.getQuestion(2) is None
    True
    >>> target.getQuestion(12345) is None
    True

== Creating some additional questions ==

For the following methods, we will require some more questions. Create five
new questions. Odd questions will be owned by foo_bar and even questions will be
owned by sample_person.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> foo_bar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> questions = []
    >>> for num in range(5):
    ...     if num % 2:
    ...         owner = foo_bar
    ...     else:
    ...         owner = sample_person
    ...     description = ('Support request description%d.\n'
    ...         'This request index is %d.') % (num, num)
    ...     questions.append(target.newQuestion(
    ...         owner, 'Question title%d' % num, description,
    ...         datecreated=now+timedelta(minutes=num+1)))

For more variety, we will set the status of the last to INVALID and the
fourth one to ANSWERED.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> foo_bar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> message = questions[-1].reject(
    ...     foo_bar, 'Invalid question.', datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=1))
    >>> message = questions[3].giveAnswer(
    ...     sample_person, 'This is your answer.',
    ...     datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=1))

Also add a reply from the owner on the first of these.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> message = questions[0].giveInfo(
    ...     'I think I forgot something.', datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=4))

And create another one that will also have the word 'new' in its
description.

    >>> question = target.newQuestion(sample_person, 'Another question',
    ...     'Another new question that is actually very new.',
    ...     datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=1))
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

    # Flush those changes to the database.
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()

== searchQuestions() ==

The searchQuestions() method is used to search for questions.

=== search_text ===

The search_text parameter will select the questions that contain the
passed in text. (The standard text searching algorithm is used, see
textsearching.txt.)

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(search_text='new'):
    ...     print t.title
    New question
    Another question

The results here are sorted by relevancy. (In the last questions, 'New'
appeared in the description which makes it less relevant than when the
word appears in the title.)

=== status ===

The searchQuestions() method can also filter questions by status:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import QuestionStatus
    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(status=QuestionStatus.OPEN):
    ...     print t.title
    Another question
    Question title2
    Question title1
    Question title0
    De l'aide S.V.P.
    New question

In this previous example, because there is no sort text, the
default sort order is from newest to oldest.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(status=QuestionStatus.INVALID):
    ...     print t.title
    Question title4

You can also pass in a list of status, and you can also use the
search_text and status parameters at the same time. This will search
OPEN and INVALID questions with the word 'index'

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(search_text='request index',
    ...         status=(QuestionStatus.OPEN, QuestionStatus.INVALID)):
    ...     print t.title
    Question title4
    Question title2
    Question title1
    Question title0

=== sort ===

You can control the sort order by passing one of the constants defined
in QuestionSort. (We already saw the NEWEST_FIRST and RELEVANCY sort
order).

You can sort also from oldest to newest using the OLDEST_FIRST constant:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import QuestionSort

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(search_text='new',
    ...                               sort=QuestionSort.OLDEST_FIRST):
    ...     print t.title
    New question
    Another question

You can sort by status, (the status order is OPEN, NEEDSINFO, ANSWERED,
SOLVED, EXPIRED, INVALID), this also sorts from newest to oldest as a
secondary key.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(search_text='request index',
    ...                               status=None,
    ...                               sort=QuestionSort.STATUS):
    ...     print t.status.title, t.title
    Open Question title2
    Open Question title1
    Open Question title0
    Answered Question title3
    Invalid Question title4

(In the previous example, we used status=None to search for all
statuses, by default INVALID and EXPIRED questions are excluded.)

If there is no search_text and the requested sort order is RELEVANCY,
the questions will be sorted NEWEST_FIRST.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(sort=QuestionSort.RELEVANCY):
    ...     print t.title
    Another question
    Question title3
    Question title2
    Question title1
    Question title0
    De l'aide S.V.P.
    New question

('Question title4' is not shown in this case because it has INVALID as
its status.)

The RECENT_OWNER_ACTIVITY sort order sorts first questions which recently
received a new message by their owner. (It effectively sorts
descending on the datelastquery attribute.)

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(sort=QuestionSort.RECENT_OWNER_ACTIVITY):
    ...     print t.title
    Question title0
    Another question
    Question title3
    Question title2
    Question title1
    De l'aide S.V.P.
    New question

(Question title0 sorts first because it had a message from its owner
after the others were created.)

=== owner ===

You can also find question owner by a particular user by using the owner
parameter.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(owner=foo_bar):
    ...     print t.title
    Question title3
    Question title1

=== language ===

The language criteria can be used to select only questions written in a
particular language.

    >>> english = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en']
    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(language=french):
    ...     print t.title
    De l'aide S.V.P.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(language=[english, french]):
    ...     print t.title
    Another question
    Question title3
    Question title2
    Question title1
    Question title0
    De l'aide S.V.P.
    New question

=== needs_attention_from ===

You can also search among the questions that needs the attention of
somebody. A question needs the attention of a user if he owns it and that
it is in the NEEDSINFO or ANSWERED state. Questions on which the user gave
an answer or requested for more information and that are back in the
OPEN state are also included.

    # One of Sample Person's question gets to need attention from Foo Bar.
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> message = questions[0].requestInfo(
    ...     foo_bar, 'Do you have a clue?',
    ...     datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=1))
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> message = questions[0].giveInfo(
    ... 'I do, now please help me.', datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=2))

    # Another one of Foo Bar's question needs attention.
    >>> message = questions[1].requestInfo(
    ...     sample_person, 'And you, do you have a clue?',
    ...     datecreated=now+timedelta(hours=1))

    # Flush those changes to the database.
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(needs_attention_from=foo_bar):
    ...     print t.status.title, t.title, t.owner.displayname
    Answered Question title3 Foo Bar
    Needs information Question title1 Foo Bar
    Open Question title0 Sample Person

=== unsupported ===

The 'unsupported' criteria is used to select questions that are in a
language that is not spoken by any of the Support Contacts.

    >>> for t in target.searchQuestions(unsupported=True):
    ...     print t.title
    De l'aide S.V.P.

== findSimilarQuestions() ==

The method findSimilarQuestions() can be use to find questions similar to a
sentence. The questions don't have to contain all the words of the sentence,
just some.

    >>> for t in target.findSimilarQuestions('new questions with a title'):
    ...     print t.title
    New question
    Another question

In this case, it returned the same results than with the search 'new' because
all other words in the sentence are either common ('question', 'title') or stop
words ('with', 'a').

== Answer contacts ==

Target can have answer contacts. The list of answer contacts for a
target is available through the answer_contacts attribute.

    >>> list(target.answer_contacts)
    []

There is also a direct_answer_contacts which includes only the
answer contacts registered explicitly on the question target. (In
general, it will be equal to answer_contacts attribute, but some
IQuestionTarget implementations may inherit answer contacts
from other context. In these cases, that attribute would only contain
the answer contacts defined in the current IQuestionTarget context.)

    >>> list(target.direct_answer_contacts)
    []

You add an answer contact by using the addAnswerContact method. This
is only available to registered users.

    >>> name18 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name18')
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(name18)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized...
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')

You cannot add an answer contact with the limited_languages=True
parameter when the Person has not configured his preferred languages.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import shortlist
    >>> shortlist(name18.languages)
    []
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(name18, limited_languages=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    AssertionError: name18 has no supported languages to limit... 
    
This method will return True when the contact was added the list and
False when it was already on the list:

    >>> target.addAnswerContact(name18)
    True
    >>> [p.name for p in target.answer_contacts]
    [u'name18']
    >>> [p.name for p in target.direct_answer_contacts]
    [u'name18']
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(name18)
    False

Answer contacts can be removed by using the removeAnswerContact()
method. Like its counterpart, it returns True when the answer contact
was removed and False when the person wasn't on the answer contact
list.

    >>> target.removeAnswerContact(name18)
    True
    >>> list(target.answer_contacts)
    []
    >>> list(target.direct_answer_contacts)
    []
    >>> target.removeAnswerContact(name18)
    False

Only registered users can remove an answer contact:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> target.removeAnswerContact(name18)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized...
    
Note see Limited Answer Contacts and getAnswerContactsForLanguage()
below for

== Supported Languages ==

The supported languages for a given IQuestionTarget are given by
getSupportedLanguages(). The supported languages of a question target
include English plus all languages spoken by at least one of its answer
contacts (with the exception of all English variations).

    >>> [lang.code for lang in target.getSupportedLanguages()]
    [u'en']

Let's add some answer contacts which speak different languages.

    >>> login('daf@canonical.com')
    >>> daf = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('daf')
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(daf)
    True

    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')
    >>> carlos = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('carlos')
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(carlos)
    True

    >>> [lang.code for lang in carlos.languages]
    [u'ca', u'es']

Note that daf has en_GB as one of his preferred languages...

    >>> [lang.code for lang in daf.languages]
    [u'en_GB', u'ja', u'cy']

... but en_GB is not included in the target's supported languages,
because we ignore all English variants.

    >>> import operator
    >>> [lang.code for lang in sorted(target.getSupportedLanguages(),
    ...                               key=operator.attrgetter('code'))]
    [u'ca', u'cy', u'en', u'es', u'ja']

== Limited Answer Contacts ==

Answer contacts may choose to receive notifications for a limited set
of languages; refusing English, the default support language. The
limited_answer_contacts property returns the subset of answer_contacts
that indicated they limit their support to their preferred languages.

    >>> sorted([person.name for person in target.answer_contacts])
    [u'carlos', u'daf']
    
    >>> list(target.limited_answer_contacts)
    []
    
    >>> target.addAnswerContact(carlos, limited_languages=True)
    True
    
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> sorted([person.name for person in target.limited_answer_contacts])
    [u'carlos']

Carlos is still in the set of answer contacts.

    >>> sorted([person.name for person in target.answer_contacts])
    [u'carlos', u'daf']


== getAnswerContactsForLanguage() ==

Continuing from the previous section with Carlos and Daf, the 
getAnswerContactsForLanguage() method returns a list of answer contacts
who support the specified language.  Support is determined in two ways:
One, the person is a regular answer contact and the language is the 
default support language of English (Dafydd in this example). Or two, 
the language is among the contacts preferred languages (both Dafydd and
Carlos).
    
    >>> spanish = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['es']
    >>> answer_contacts = target.getAnswerContactsForLanguage(spanish)
    >>> sorted([person.name for person in answer_contacts])
    [u'carlos', u'daf']
    
    >>> answer_contacts = target.getAnswerContactsForLanguage(english)
    >>> sorted([person.name for person in answer_contacts])
    [u'daf']
        
== getQuestionLanguages() ==

The getQuestionLanguages() method returns the set of languages used by all
of the target's questions.

    >>> sorted([language.code for language in target.getQuestionLanguages()])
    [u'en', u'fr']
