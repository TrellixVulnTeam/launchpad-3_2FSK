We would like to test various features of the home page. This will prevent
accidental regressions in the layout of the home page.

First, we should be seeing a translation box for Ubuntu Hoary into
Afrikaans:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,af;q=0.3
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Afrikaans:...
  .../distros/ubuntu/hoary/+lang/af...


Next, we also expect to see the top contributors (by Karma) listed on the
home page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Mark Shuttleworth...
