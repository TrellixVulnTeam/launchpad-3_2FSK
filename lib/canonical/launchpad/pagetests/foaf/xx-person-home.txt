Personal Home Pages
===================

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person

Carlos can never see name12's email addresses: he has chosen not to disclose
them.

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic marilize@hbd.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12')

  >>> name12 = Person.get(12)
  >>> name12.preferredemail.email
  u'test@canonical.com'
  >>> name12.hide_email_addresses
  True

  >>> str(name12.preferredemail.email) in browser.contents
  False

Mark has a registered email address, and he has chosen to disclose it to
the world.

  >>> mark = Person.get(1)
  >>> mark.preferredemail.email
  u'mark@hbd.com'
  >>> mark.hide_email_addresses
  False

If you are not logged in, you will not be able to see it:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
  >>> str(mark.preferredemail.email) in anon_browser.contents
  False

If you log in, however, you will:

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
  >>> str(mark.preferredemail.email) in browser.contents
  True

A person's homepage also lists timezone, Karma and status information:

  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
  Summary
  Karma: 130
  Timezone: UTC
  Member since: 2005-06-06

Negative Ubuntero status is only displayed for yourself; others won't
see it:

  >>> "Ubuntero:" in browser.contents
  False

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic mark@hbd.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-details'))
  Summary
  ...
  Ubuntero: No (apply now)
  ...

You can grab certain bits of information programatically:

  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'karma-total'))
  130
  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'member-since'))
  2005-06-06

Teams don't have member-since; they have created-date:

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~guadamen')
  >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'created-date'))
  2005-06-06

Launchpad creates profiles for people that have contributed to free software
(e.g. in a bug import or a translation template upload). It's clearly
stated that those people don't use Launchpad and why there's a profile for
them.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~limi')
  >>> browser.title
  'Alexander Limi does not use Launchpad'

  >>> content = find_main_content(browser.contents).find('p')
  >>> print extract_text(content)
  Alexander Limi does not use Launchpad. This page was created on 2005-06-06
  when importing bugs from http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/.


== Table of contributions ==

A person's home page also displays a table with the contributions made by that
person. This table includes 5 projects in which this person is most active
and also the areas in which (s)he worked on each project.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name16')
    >>> table = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    >>> for tr in table.findAll('tr'):
    ...     print tr.find('th').find('a').renderContents()
    ...     for td in tr.findAll('td'):
    ...         img = td.find('img')
    ...         if img is not None:
    ...             print "\t", img['title']
    The Evolution Groupware ...
       Bug Management
       Translations in Rosetta
    Ubuntu Linux
       Bug Management
    Gnome Baker
       Bug Management
    Mozilla Thunderbird

If the person hasn't made any contributions, the table is not present in its
page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~jdub')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    None

The same for teams.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    None
