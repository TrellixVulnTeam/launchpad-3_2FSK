= Build Pages =

For the subsequent tests we will use a specific 'pmount' build record
from the sampledata which happens to be in FAILEDTOBUILD status.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter, getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBuildSet
    >>> failed_build = getUtility(IBuildSet).getByBuildID(9)

    >>> print failed_build.title
    i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu warty RELEASE

    >>> print failed_build.buildstate.name
    FAILEDTOBUILD

    >>> print failed_build.archive.title
    Primary Archive for Ubuntu Linux


== Build Structural Header and Menu ==

The IBuild record is adapted to a IStructuralHeaderPresentation by a
custom factury function, build_to_structuralheading, which reuses the
IBuild.archive header.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.browser import build_to_structuralheading
    >>> import zope.i18n

As mentioned above, the build is targeted to the ubuntu PRIMARY
archive, so the page header refers to the distribution (see
browser.archive.archive_to_structuralheading).

    >>> failed_build_shp = build_to_structuralheading(failed_build)
    >>> print zope.i18n.translate(failed_build_shp.getMainHeading())
    Ubuntu Linux

In a similar way, the menu presented in the build page depends on the
targeted archive. For instance the 'PPA' action-menu link is not
enabled for builds targeted to the PRIMARY archive.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.browser import BuildContextMenu
    >>> build_menu = BuildContextMenu(failed_build)

    >>> print build_menu.links
    ['ppa', 'records', 'retry', 'rescore']

    >>> build_menu.is_ppa_build
    False

    >>> build_menu.ppa().enabled
    False

On the other hand, if we modify the build to be targeted to Celso's
PPA, its header will refer to the PPA owner.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> original_archive = failed_build.archive

    >>> naked_failed_build = removeSecurityProxy(failed_build)
    >>> naked_failed_build.archive = cprov.archive

    >>> failed_build_shp = build_to_structuralheading(failed_build)
    >>> print zope.i18n.translate(failed_build_shp.getMainHeading())
    Celso Providelo

Now we have a enabled 'PPA' action-menu item, since the build is
targeted to a PPA.

    >>> build_menu = BuildContextMenu(failed_build)

    >>> print build_menu.links
    ['ppa', 'records', 'retry', 'rescore']

    >>> build_menu.is_ppa_build
    True

    >>> build_menu.ppa().enabled
    True

We will restore the original 'failed_build' archive for the next
tests.

    >>> naked_failed_build.archive = original_archive


== Build +index page ==

Setup a 'empty' request:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> empty_request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form={})

Let's instantiate the view for +index:

    >>> failed_build_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (failed_build, empty_request), name="+index")
