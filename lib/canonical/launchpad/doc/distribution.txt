Distributions
=============

From the DerivationOverview spec[1]:

    A distribution of GNU/Linux comprises a set of packages, an installer,
    possibly a live-CD, some amount of metadata associated with the arrangement
    of those elements and also a lot of information on managing it.

In Launchpad, one distribution is mapped to one row in the Distribution table.
To retrieve a distribution, use the IDistributionSet utility. If you've already
used IPersonSet to retrieve a Person, or IBugTaskSet to retrieve a task, this
syntax should look familiar.

The IDistributionSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> distroset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)

To retrieve a specific distribution, use IDistributionSet.get:

    >>> ubuntu = distroset.get(1)
    >>> print ubuntu.name
    ubuntu

Once you've got a distribution, you can retrieve a source package if you
have a SourcePackageName object for it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.sourcepackagename import SourcePackageName
    >>> evo = SourcePackageName.byName("evolution")
    >>> evo_ubuntu = ubuntu.getSourcePackage(evo)
    >>> print evo_ubuntu.name
    evolution

You can also get a release by name:

    >>> hoary = ubuntu.getRelease("hoary")
    >>> print hoary.name
    hoary

Or by version:

    >>> v504 = ubuntu.getRelease("5.04")
    >>> print v504.name
    hoary

You can list development distroreleases:

    >>> devdists = ubuntu.getDevelopmentReleases()
    >>> for devdist in devdists:
    ...     print devdist.name
    hoary
