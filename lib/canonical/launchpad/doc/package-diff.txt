= Package Diff =

The 'package-diff' subsystem allows users to request a diff between
two SourcePackageReleases.

The diff can be requested by any user with permission to view both
packages and will be performed frequently by our infraestructure.


== Requesting a Diff ==

First we have to retrieve a SourcePackageRelease from the sampledata,
let's use 'pmount' sources.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IPersonSet)

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> pmount = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('pmount')

    >>> pmount_from = pmount['0.1-2'].sourcepackagerelease
    >>> pmount_to = pmount['0.1-1'].sourcepackagerelease

Requesting a diff from pmount_0.1-2 to pmount_0.1-1.

    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> package_diff = pmount_from.requestDiffTo(
    ...     requester=cprov, to_source=pmount_to)

Let's inspect the PackageDiff record created.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPackageDiff
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject

    >>> verifyObject(IPackageDiff, package_diff)
    True

    >>> print package_diff.requester.displayname
    Celso Providelo

    >>> print package_diff.from_source.title
    pmount - 0.1-2

    >>> print package_diff.to_source.title
    pmount - 0.1-1

Since the PackageDiff was not yet performed, both, 'date_fulfilled'
and 'diff_content' attributes are empty.

    >>> print package_diff.date_fulfilled
    None

    >>> print package_diff.diff_content
    None

IPackageDiff offers a property that return the 'title' of the diff request.

    >>> print package_diff.title
    Package diff from pmount - 0.1-2 to pmount - 0.1-1
