    <h1>About Soyuz</h1>

    <p>
    Soyuz is a Linux Distribution Management System. It allows you to create
    your own Linux distribution, selecting the packages that you want to
    include in the distro, managing uploads and builds across multiple
    architectures, and ultimately giving you an installation CD and Live CD.
