== Purging lists ==

A team mailing list can, under certain circumstances, be purged by a Mailing
List Expert or Launchpad administrator.  Purging is an assertion that there
are no data structures on the Mailman side that we care about.  This is not
enforced by Launchpad, and a purging a list invokes no communication between
the two systems.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import mailinglists_helper
    >>> team_one, list_one = mailinglists_helper.new_team(
    ...     'team-one', with_list=True)

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> the_owner = team_one.teamowner.preferredemail.email

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.launchpad import (
    ...     ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> celebrities = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> an_expert = list(celebrities.mailing_list_experts.allmembers)[0]
    >>> an_admin = list(celebrities.admin.allmembers)[0]

    >>> def create_view(principal):
    ...     return create_initialized_view(
    ...         team_one, '+mailinglist', principal=principal)

Nobody can purge an active mailing list, the team owner...

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.systemdocs import (
    ...     create_initialized_view)

    >>> view = create_view(the_owner)
    >>> print view.label
    Mailing list configuration

...a mailing list expert...

    >>> view = create_view(an_expert)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    False

...or a Launchpad administrator.

    >>> view = create_view(an_admin)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    False

Now the team owner deactivates the mailing list.  When this completes
successfully, the mailing list will have been archived and removed on the
Mailman side.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> view = create_view(an_admin)
    >>> list_one.deactivate()
    >>> mailinglists_helper.mailman.act()
    >>> transaction.commit()

The team owner cannot purge his list...

    >>> view = create_view(the_owner)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    False

...but a Launchpad administrator, or mailing list expert can purge the mailing
list.

    >>> view = create_view(an_admin)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    True

    >>> view = create_view(an_expert)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    True


== Like it never existed ==

A list which has been purged acts, for all intents and purposes, as if the
mailing list doesn't exist.  For example, once purged, it can be re-requested,
but not re-activated.

    >>> list_one.purge()
    >>> view = create_view(the_owner)
    >>> view.list_can_be_requested
    True
    >>> view.list_can_be_deactivated
    False
    >>> view.list_can_be_reactivated
    False
    >>> view.list_application_can_be_cancelled
    False

Of course, while purged, the mailing list cannot be purged again.

    >>> view = create_view(an_expert)
    >>> view.list_can_be_purged
    False
