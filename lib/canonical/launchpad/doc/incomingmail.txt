Incoming Mail
===============

When an email is sent to Launchpad we need to handle it somehow. This
is done by handleEmails:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail.incoming import handleMail

Basically what it does is to open the Launchpad mail box, and for each
message it:

    * Authenticates the sender
    * Finds the correct mail handler
    * Lets the handler process the message
    * Deletes the message from the mail box

Mail Handlers
-------------

A mail handler is a utility which knows how to handle mail sent to a
specific domain. It is registered as a named utility providing
IMailHandler. The name of the utility is the domain that's handled.

Let's create some utilities which keep track of which mails they
handle, and register them for some domains:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMailHandler
    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> class MockHandler:
    ...     implements(IMailHandler)
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.handledMails = []
    ...     def process(self, mail, to_addr, filealias):
    ...         self.handledMails.append(mail['Message-Id'])
    ...         return True

    >>> from zope.app.tests import ztapi
    >>> foo_handler = MockHandler()
    >>> bar_handler = MockHandler()
    >>> ztapi.provideUtility(IMailHandler, foo_handler, 'foo.com')
    >>> ztapi.provideUtility(IMailHandler, bar_handler, 'bar.com')

Now we send a few test mails to foo.com, bar.com, and baz.com:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import read_test_message
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import sendmail

    >>> msgids = {'foo.com': [], 'bar.com': [], 'baz.com': []}
    >>> for domain in ('foo.com', 'bar.com', 'foo.com', 'baz.com'):
    ...     msg = read_test_message('signed_detached.txt')
    ...     msg.replace_header('To', '123@%s' % domain)
    ...     msgids[domain].append("<%s>" % sendmail(msg))
    ...     transaction.commit()

The test mails are now in Launchpad's mail box, so now we can call
handleMail, so that every mail gets handled by the correct handler.
Since the User gets authenticated using GPG signatures we have to
import the keys first. We also need to start the Librarian, since every
mail will get filed in there:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
    >>> from canonical.librarian.ftests.harness import LibrarianTestSetup
    >>> import_public_test_keys()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> LibrarianTestSetup().setUp()

    >>> handleMail()

Now we can see that each handler handled that mails sent to its domain:

    >>> foo_handler.handledMails == msgids['foo.com']
    True
    >>> bar_handler.handledMails == msgids['bar.com']
    True


Unhandled Mail
--------------

So, what happened to the message that got sent to baz.com? Since there
wasn't a handler registered for that domain, an error message was sent
to the errors email address, which specified in launchpad.conf as
errors_address.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> to_addrs = [to_addr_list[0]
    ...             for from_addr, to_addr_list, raw_mail in stub.test_emails]
    >>> to_addrs == [config.launchpad.errors_address]
    True

    >>> stub.test_emails = []

Now let's send an email from Foo Bar, but signed with Sample Person's
key:

    >>> msg = read_test_message('signed_detached.txt')
    >>> msg.replace_header('From', 'foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> msgid = sendmail(msg)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> handleMail(transaction)


An error message was sent since the key didn't belong to Foo Bar:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> from_addr, to_addr, raw_mail = stub.test_emails[-1]
    >>> import email
    >>> error_mail = email.message_from_string(raw_mail)
    >>> print error_mail['Subject']
    Unhandled Email: ...
    >>> print error_mail.get_payload(decode=True)
    The following email was unhandled:
    ...
    Invalid signature for foo.bar@canonical.com:
        The key used to sign the email doesn't belong to the user.


X-Original-To
-------------

If available, the X-Original-To header is used to determine to which
address the email was sent to:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import raw_sendmail
    >>> msg = read_test_message('signed_detached.txt')
    >>> msg.replace_header('To', '123@foo.com')
    >>> msg['CC'] = '123@foo.com'
    >>> msg['X-Original-To'] = '123@bar.com'
    >>> msgid = '<%s>' % raw_sendmail (
    ...     msg['From'], ['123@bar.com'], msg.as_string())
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> handleMail()
    >>> msgid in bar_handler.handledMails
    True

Only the address in X-Original-To header will be used. The addresses in
the To and CC headers will be ignored:

    >>> msgid in foo_handler.handledMails
    False


    >>> LibrarianTestSetup().tearDown()
