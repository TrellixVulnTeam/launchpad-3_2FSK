= Branch Associations =

Branches have connections to many things.  Particularly branches have
links to bugs and blueprints.  Branches also have badges in listing views
to show the these associations.

One of the main intentions for the branch associations listing page is to
have somewhere useful for the badges to hyperlink to.


== Getting to the branch associations ==

There is an action item on branches that any user can click on called
'View branch associations'.  This link takes the user to the page that
lists all the links or associations the branch has.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9.2')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('View branch associations').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    Mozilla Firefox 0.9.2 for the Mozilla Firefox (Unspecified) project
    Branch associations
    Project
      Mozilla Firefox (Unspecified)
    Bugs
      Reflow problems with complex page layouts
    Blueprints
      This branch is not associated with any blueprints at this time.
    Subscribers
      This branch has no subscribers at this time.

Junk branches do not have a section listing the project.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/+junk/testdoc')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('View branch associations').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    ~sabdfl/+junk/testdoc
    Branch associations

== Associations are links ==

The items listed in the branch associtaion sections are links.

Firstly make sure that the branch has some blueprint links and subscribers.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/firefox/+spec/canvas')
    >>> browser.getLink('Link to branch').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Branch').value = '~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9.2'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9.2')
    >>> browser.getLink('Subscribe').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Subscribe').click()
    >>> browser.getLink('View branch associations').click()
    >>> associations_url = browser.url

The project link, if the branch is not junk, links back to the branch listing
for the project.

    >>> import re
    >>> browser.getLink(re.compile('Mozilla Firefox$')).click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox'
    >>> # goBack() and reload() seems to not work with PQM
    >>> browser.open(associations_url)

The listed bugs link to the main bug page.

    >>> browser.getLink('Reflow problems with complex page layouts').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/4'
    >>> browser.open(associations_url)

The listed blueprints link to the main blueprint page.

    >>> browser.getLink('Support <canvas> Objects').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/firefox/+spec/canvas'
    >>> browser.open(associations_url)

The listed subscribers link to the code listing pages for the people or teams.

    # Since we are logged in as Sample Person there are two links that
    # have Sample Person, so checking the link by getting the surrounding
    # div.
    >>> div = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branch-subscribers')
    >>> print div.renderContents()
    <div class="indented">
      <a href="http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12"><img alt=""
      width="14" height="14" src="/@@/person" />&nbsp;Sample Person</a>
    </div>
