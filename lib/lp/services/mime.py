    # for Intrepid, to add .debdiff to /etc/mime.types, so we may be able
    # to remove this setting once a new /etc/mime.types has been installed
    # on the app servers. Additionally, Firefox does not display content
    # of type text/x-diff inline, so making this text/plain because
    # viewing .debdiff inline is the most common use-case.
