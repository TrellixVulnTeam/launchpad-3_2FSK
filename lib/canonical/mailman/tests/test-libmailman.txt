Launchpad doesn't need to talk directly to Mailman, but we can still test that
Mailman exists and seems properly configured, and that Launchpad can import
the libmailman common package.  Anything more than that is left to other
tests.

    >>> import libmailman

Does Mailman seem properly configured.  It does if the site list exists.  This
`bin/withlist` script does just that.

    >>> callable = 'canonical.mailman.tests.launchpad.launchpad'
    >>> call('./withlist -q -r %s mailman', callable)
