= Product code overview =

The default page shown on the code rootsite for a product is
a summary of the branches for the project.

The page has the following important elements:
  * A link to the branch listing for the product
  * A clear way to show the branches associated with the product series
  * The branches with the most recent revisions
  * The most recently registered branches


== Link to branch listings ==

The link to the branch listing is the first thing on the page.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> print browser.title
    Code overview for Mozilla Firefox

    >>> browser.getLink('List currently active branches').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox's Bazaar branches registered in Launchpad


== Branches associated with product series ==

These are shown under the heading 'Official branches' as these are
the 'blessed' branches for the product.

If there are no branches associated with the product series, then
the user is told this.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> def print_official_branches(browser):
    ...     official_branches = find_portlet(
    ...         browser.contents, 'Official branches')
    ...     for div in official_branches.findAll('div', recursive=False):
    ...         # The first div in this div contains the highlighting class.
    ...         print '---\nCSS style: %s' % div.div['class']
    ...         print extract_text(div)
    >>> print_official_branches(browser)
    ---
    CSS style: highlighted
    Series: trunk Current development focus
    No branch specified
    ---
    CSS style: unhighlighted
    Series: 1.0
    No branch specified

Specify a branch as the main development focus branch.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk/+source')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="field.user_branch").value = (
    ...     '~name12/firefox/main')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Update Details').click()

And set a branch for the 1.0 series.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox/1.0/+source')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name="field.user_branch").value = (
    ...     '~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Update Details').click()

This branch is now shown, along with the bzr branch example.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> print_official_branches(browser)
    ---
    CSS style: highlighted
    Series: trunk   Current development focus

    ---
    CSS style: unhighlighted
    Series: 1.0
    Branch: release-0.9: Mozilla Firefox 0.9
    Example: bzr branch lp:firefox/1.0


== Recent revisions ==

The branches that have the most recent revisions are shown, along with
the commit message, time and committer of the revision.  There is also
a codebrowse link on the revision number.

    >>> revisions = find_portlet(
    ...     browser.contents, 'Recent revisions')
    >>> print extract_text(revisions)
    Recent revisions
    These are the branches with the most recent revisions.
