= PPA Package Copying =

We allow uses to copy packages from PPAs they can view to another that
they upload packages to.

A package is copied by accessing a special PPA page that allows user
to select:

 * One or more source packages from the current PPA;
 * A destination PPA amongst the ones he has access to, including the
   current one;
 * A destination series amongst all ubuntu series;
 * Whether or not to copy the binaries published by the selected
   sources in the current PPA.

The copy occurs immediately in the publishing records domain, so the
packages copied will be visible in the destination PPA page as
PENDING. The files will be published in the destination PPA archive
disk during the next publishing cycle, see `publishing.txt` for more
information.

== Who can copy packages ? ==

Copying is only permitted for valid users, so Anonymous user can't
access 'Copy package' page from any PPA.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/+copy-packages')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ... 'launchpad.AnyPerson')

James is a valid user, however he doesn't have access to any PPA, he
is allowed to access the copy-package interface in Celso's PPA, but
the form is not rendered, instead he is advised to activate his own
PPA in order to be able to copy packages.

    >>> jblack_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic james.blackwell@ubuntulinux.com:jblack")

    >>> jblack_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive')
    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(jblack_browser.contents))
    Copy packages from PPA for Celso Providelo
    For copying packages you have to participate at least of one
    PPA. Activate your own PPA or join a team with a active PPA.

James will follow the advice and activate his PPA by clicking in the
provided link.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Activate your own PPA').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    Activate Personal Package Archive

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name="field.accepted").value = True
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name="field.description").value = (
    ...    'There we go ...')
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Activate").click()

    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    PPA for James Blackwell

Now, that James has his own PPA, he navigates back to Celso's PPA
copy package interface can see packages to be copied.

    >>> jblack_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive')
    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()

    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)

    pmount - 0.1-1  2007-07-09  Published  Warty            Editors


== How does this copy-thing work ? ==

As mentioned before, James can select one or more sources to be copied
to a PPA he has permission to upload.

Let's say James wants to rebuild the Celso's 'pmount' source in his PPA.

He is a little confused by the number of packages presented by
default and wants to refine the options.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.name_filter').value = 'pmount'
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Update").click()

There we go, James can be certain about which package to select, only
pmount is presented.

    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)
    Source          Published   Status     Series           Section  Built
    pmount - 0.1-1  2007-07-09  Published  Warty            Editors

James is intrigued and wants to see more information about this
source, thus he expands the hidden details-section area below the
'pmount' row to read its changelog.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> [pmount_pub] = cprov.archive.getPublishedSources(name='pmount')
    >>> pmount_pub_id = pmount_pub.id
    >>> logout()

    >>> pmount_details_id = 'pub%d' % pmount_pub_id
    >>> pmount_details = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     jblack_browser.contents, pmount_details_id)

James is absolutely that's the package he wants, he selects it.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [str(pmount_pub_id)]

Currently, James only has access to his just created PPA, which is the
default form value for 'Destination PPA'.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination PPA').displayOptions
    ['PPA for James Blackwell']

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination PPA').value
    ['jblack']

James notice that Celso's 'pmount' was uploaded and built in Warty,
but he is using Hoary. No problem, because he can select a destination
series while copying.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').displayOptions
    ['The same series', 'Breezy Badger Autotest', 'Grumpy', 'Hoary', 'Warty']

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value
    ['']

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value = ['hoary']

And finally whether or not to copy binaries, James wants to rebuild
it, so he leaves it unchecked.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl('Copy binaries').selected
    False

James 'pushes the button', copy is done and a summary of the operation
is presented.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()

    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    Packages copied to PPA for James Blackwell:

James uses the link in the copy summary to got straight to the target
PPA, his own. There he can see the just copied package as PENDING and
also marked as pending build for i386.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('PPA for James Blackwell').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title

Expanding the details area, James can see that the source copied is
indeed the same by checking the changelog, also that the binaries
were not copied and intead a build was already created in his PPA context.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> jblack = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jblack')

James quickly goes to the build page and certifies himself that the
build created during the copy is ready to be dispatched.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('i386').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title

Very nice, but now James got really excited about the possibilities ...


=== Copying packages within the PPA ===

James thinks that having Celso's 'pmount' copy in his PPA for hoary is
great, however some of his friends are already using grumpy, the new
and shine ubuntu series.

He is aware that the PPA system would not allow him to download pmount
and simply re-upload it to another series, because the it's files are
already in pool and can't be overridden.

James, thinks for a minute and realises that he could copy the
'pmount' source already in his PPA from hoary to grumpy.

We have to do some preparation in grumpy's sampledata to make it ready
for packages. This is certainly not part of the doctest story.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.processor import ProcessorFamily
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> grumpy = ubuntu.getSeries('grumpy')
    >>> grumpy_i386 = grumpy.newArch(
    ...     'i386', ProcessorFamily.get(1), False, cprov,
    ...     ppa_supported=True)
    >>> grumpy.nominatedarchindep = grumpy_i386
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

James goes straight to the copy interface of his PPA.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('View PPA').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    PPA for James Blackwell

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    Copy packages from PPA for James Blackwell

    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)
    Source          Published   Status     Series           Section  Built
    pmount - 0.1-1              Pending    Hoary            Editors  i386

Then selects pmount in hoary.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [str(pmount_pub_id)]

Let the Destination PPA alone, because it defaults to 'This PPA'.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination PPA').displayValue
    ['This PPA']

James is too excited and rapidly hit the 'Copy Packages' button before
actually selecting the wanted destination series.

The destination series always default to 'The same series'.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').displayValue
    ['The same series']

When he requests the copy a error is raised, since a copy to 'This
PPA' and 'The same series' is not allowed because it results in
publishing cruft (the former publishing record will be dominated and
the archive won't be changed).

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()
    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    There is 1 error.
    Select a different series.

Without thinking much James erroneously selects 'hoary' series and
pushes the copy button. The same error is raised.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [str(pmount_pub_id)]

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value = ['hoary']

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()
    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    There is 1 error.
    The following source cannot be copied because it
    was targeted to the same location: pmount 0.1-1 in hoary

Darn, now James being more careful and re-selects the 'pmount' source
and 'grumpy' as Destination Series.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [str(pmount_pub_id)]

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value = ['grumpy']

Let Copy Binaries alone, i.e. disabled.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl('Copy binaries').selected
    False

All done and reviewed, James pushes the button.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()

The page not only renders the copy summary, but also shows the
package copied in the available sources.

    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    Packages copied to PPA for James Blackwell:
    pmount 0.1-1 in grumpy

    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)
    Source          Published   Status     Series           Section  Built
    pmount - 0.1-1              Pending    Grumpy           Editors  i386
    pmount - 0.1-1              Pending    Hoary            Editors  i386

Note that the builds for pmount in grumpy where also created.

After some time, James realises that pmount in hoary doesn't make much
sense and simply deletes it, so his users won't be bothered by this
boken package.

We will publish all sources in James' PPA so the will show up in the
delete-packages interface.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> jblack = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jblack')
    >>> for source in jblack.archive.getPublishedSources():
    ...     source.secure_record.status = PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

James uses the 'delete-packages' interface in his PPA to delete the
'pmount' source in hoary.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [str(pmount_pub_id)]
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    "Deletion comment").value = "Deleted packages can be copied."
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()

James return to his PPA overview page and checks that the package is
really deleted.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('View PPA').click()
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name='field.status_filter').value = ['any']
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Search").click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)
    Source          Published   Status     Series           Section  Built
    pmount - 0.1-1              Published  Grumpy           Editors  i386
    pmount - 0.1-1              Deleted    Hoary            Editors  i386

In the minute after James had deleted the package, he discovered that
'pmount' might build correctly in warty.

No problem, he goes back to the copy-package interface in his PPA and
still able to copy the deleted source to the warty series.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()
    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:

publication.

=== Copying packages to other PPAs you participate ===

The Copy-UI excitement is endless for James, he informed his friends
and decided to open a team PPA where he and his friends could work
together.

    >>> jblack_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people')
    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Register a team').click()

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     name="field.name").value = 'jblack-friends'

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Display Name').value = 'James Blackwell Friends'

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Create").click()

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Activate Personal Package Archive').click()
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name="field.accepted").value = True
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name="field.description").value = (
    ...    'Come friends ...')
    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Activate").click()

    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    PPA for James Blackwell Friends

PPA created, now James want to populate it with the finest packages he
have ever seem. He goes to Celso's PPA copy interface.

    >>> jblack_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive')
    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()

James would like to re-distribute Celso's 'pmount' and 'iceweasel'
packages, thus he selects both.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> [pmount_pub] = cprov.archive.getPublishedSources(name='pmount')
    >>> pmount_pub_id = pmount_pub.id
    >>> [iceweasel_pub] = cprov.archive.getPublishedSources(name='iceweasel')
    >>> iceweasel_pub_id = iceweasel_pub.id
    >>> logout()

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(name='field.selected_sources').value = (
    ...     [str(iceweasel_pub_id), str(pmount_pub_id)])

Now that James have access to more than one PPA, the copy-package form
allows him to select one of them.

    >>> print jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination PPA').displayOptions
    ['PPA for James Blackwell', 'PPA for James Blackwell Friends']

James wants to populate the PPA for James Blackwell Friends, he
selects that.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination PPA').value = ['jblack-friends']

James decides that 'hoary' is where the action will be in for his friends.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value = ['hoary']

Also, in order to make James Friends' PPA ready to use, this time
James will also copy Celso's binaries for the selected sources.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl('Copy binaries').selected = True

Button-pushing time for James again.

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()

The page not only renders the copy summary, but also shows the
package copied in the available sources.

    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    Packages copied to PPA for James Blackwell Friends:
    iceweasel 1.0 in hoary
    mozilla-firefox 1.0 in hoary i386
    pmount 0.1-1 in hoary
    pmount 0.1-1 in hoary hppa
    pmount 0.1-1 in hoary i386

So happy-hacking for James Friends, Celso's 'iceweasel' and 'pmount'
sources and binaries are copied to their PPA.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('PPA for James Blackwell Friends').click()
    >>> print jblack_browser.title
    PPA for James Blackwell Friends

    >>> print_ppa_packages(jblack_browser.contents)

    pmount - 0.1-1   no signer               Pending  Hoary   Editors

James just gives a quick look to the details section of each copied
sources to ensure the binaries are really there.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> jblack_friends = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jblack-friends')
    >>> [pmount_pub] = jblack_friends.archive.getPublishedSources(
    ...     name='pmount')
    >>> pmount_pub_id = pmount_pub.id
    >>> [iceweasel_pub] = jblack_friends.archive.getPublishedSources(
    ...     name='iceweasel')
    >>> iceweasel_pub_id = iceweasel_pub.id
    >>> logout()

    >>> pmount_details_id = 'pub%d' % pmount_pub_id
    >>> pmount_details = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     jblack_browser.contents, pmount_details_id)
    >>> print extract_text(pmount_details)
    Publishing details
    ...
    Built Packages
      pmount
    ...

    >>> iceweasel_details_id = 'pub%d' % iceweasel_pub_id
    >>> iceweasel_details = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     jblack_browser.contents, iceweasel_details_id)
    >>> print extract_text(iceweasel_details)
    Publishing details
    ...
    Built Packages
      mozilla-firefox
      ff from iceweasel
    ...

Not using his brain again, James tries to copy the two sources to the
same location within James Blackwell Friends' PPAs, pretty much as if
he was trying to break Launchpad. Poor James, this time he gets a
plural error message.

    >>> jblack_browser.getLink('Copy packages').click()

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = [
    ...    str(pmount_pub_id), str(iceweasel_pub_id)]

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Destination series').value = ['hoary']

    >>> jblack_browser.getControl("Copy Packages").click()
    >>> messages = get_feedback_messages(jblack_browser.contents)
    >>> for msg in messages:
    ...     print msg
    There is 1 error.
    The following sources cannot be copied because they
    were targeted to the same location:
    iceweasel 1.0 in hoary, pmount 0.1-1 in hoary


That's all folks !
