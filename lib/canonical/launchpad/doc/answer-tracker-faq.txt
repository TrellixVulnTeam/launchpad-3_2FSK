== IFAQTarget ==

The Answer Tracker offers feature to manage answers to commonly asked
questions (also called FAQ). Like the regular questions, FAQ documents
are associated to distributions or products. The IFAQTarget interface
is provided by objects that can host FAQs.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IFAQTarget)

    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')

    # removeSecurityProxy() is needed because not all interface
    # attributes are available to everybody.
    >>> verifyObject(IFAQTarget, removeSecurityProxy(firefox))
    True

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> verifyObject(IFAQTarget, removeSecurityProxy(ubuntu))
    True

Any logged in user can create a new FAQ document on a project.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu_faq = ubuntu.newFAQ(
    ...     sample_person, 'Soundcard HowTo',
    ...     'How to configure sound on Feisty.',
    ...     content="You don't! It is plug-and-play(tm)")

(The complete description of the IFAQTarget is available in
lib/canonical/launchpad/interfaces/ftests/faqtarget.txt)
