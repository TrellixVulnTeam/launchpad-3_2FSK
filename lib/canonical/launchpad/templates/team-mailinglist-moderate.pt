      3 messages have been posted to your mailing list, but are being held
      pending your review for appropriateness and topicality.  For each
      message you can take one of these actions:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Approve</strong> - Accept the message, post it to the
        mailing list, and credit the original author for his or her on-topic
        posting.
        <li><strong>Decline</strong> - Reject the message, sending a bounce
        message back to the original author and giving no credit for the
        posting.  Use this action for off-topic non-spam messages.
        <li><strong>Discard</strong> - Throw the message away.  Use this
        action for obvious spam.
        <li><strong>Hold</strong> - Continue to hold the message, deferring
        your decision until later.
      </ul>

            <br>I tried to use gnome-pilot for my recent starship upgrade,

            but I found out something that surprised me.  When I told
            my friend Scotty to 'make it so', nothing happened, but when I
            told him to 'engage', my Palm finally went into warp drive.  Is
            this a bug or a feature and would it make sense to translate this
            into Klingon?
