This is a test of the minimal "Hello world" web service. GET it and
you get a string.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  Hello, world!

Though web services in general support all HTTP methods, this
particular resource supports only GET.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... DELETE / HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ...
