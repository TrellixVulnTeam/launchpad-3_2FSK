    <h1>How do I use software from a PPA?</h1>

    <p>
      To start installing and using software from a Personal Package Archive,
       you first need to tell Ubuntu where to find the PPA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> The contents of Personal Package Archives
      are not checked or monitored. You install software from them at your own
      risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding the PPA to Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) and later</h2>

    <p>
      If you're using the most recent version of Ubuntu (or any version from
      Ubuntu 9.10 onwards), you can add a PPA to your system with a single
      line in your terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> On the PPA's overview page, look for the
      heading that reads <em>Adding this PPA to your system</em>. Make a note
      of the PPA's location, which looks like:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal and enter:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Replace <code>ppa:user/ppa-name</code> with the PPA's location that you
      noted above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your system will now fetch the PPA's key. This enables your Ubuntu
      system to verify that the packages in the PPA have not been interfered
      with since they were built.
    </p>

    <img src="images/add-apt-repo2.png" alt="Screen shot of a system retrieving the PPA details" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, as a one-off, you should tell your system
      to pull down the latest list of software from each archive it knows
      about, including the PPA you just added:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you're ready to start installing software from the PPA!
    </p>

    <h2>On older (pre 9.10) Ubuntu systems</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the PPA's overview page in Launchpad.
      Look for the heading that reads Adding this PPA to your system and click
      the <em>Technical details about this PPA</em> link.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the <em>Display sources.list</em> entries
      drop-down box to select the version of Ubuntu you're using.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> You'll see that the text-box directly below
      reads something like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
        deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main<br />
        deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
     </code>
    </p>

   <p>
     Copy those lines.
   </p>

   <p>
     <strong>Step 4:</strong> Open a terminal and type:
   </p>

   <p>
     <code>sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list</code>
   </p>

   <p>
     This will open a text editor containing the list of archives that your
     system is currently using. Scroll to the bottom of the file and paste the
     lines you copied in the step above.
   </p>

   <p>
     Save the file and exit the text editor.
   </p>

   <p>
     <strong>Step 5:</strong> Back on the PPA's overview page, look for the
     <em>Signing key</em> heading. You'll see something like:
   </p>

   <p>
     <code>1024R/72D340A3 (What is this?)</code>
   </p>

   <p>
     Copy the portion after the slash but not including the help link; e.g.
     just <code>72D340A3</code>.
   </p>

   <p>
     <strong>Step 6:</strong> Now you need to add that key to your system so
     Ubuntu can verify the packages from the PPA. In your terminal, enter:
   </p>

   <p>
     <code>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
     72D340A3</code>
   </p>

   <p>
     Replace <code>72D340A3</code> with whatever you copied in the step 5.
   </p>

   <p>
     This will now pull down the PPA's key and add it to your system.
   </p>

   <p>
     <strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, as a one-off, you should tell your system
     to pull down the latest list of software from each archive it knows
     about, including the PPA you just added:
   </p>

   <p>
     <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
   </p>

   <p>
     Now you're ready to start installing software from the PPA!
