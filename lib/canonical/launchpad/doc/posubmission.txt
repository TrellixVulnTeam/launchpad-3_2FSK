= POSubmissionSet =

This class represents the set of POSubmission objects in our database.
We use it to get a concrete submission when we know its ID.

Let's do some imports we will need to test this class.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPOSubmissionSet
  >>> posubmissionset = getUtility(IPOSubmissionSet)

== getPOSubmissionByID ==

With this method, we can get the POSubmission object that has the given
id as argument or None when it doesn't exist.

We can get a POSubmission object that exists.

  >>> posubmission = posubmissionset.getPOSubmissionByID(1)
  >>> posubmission is None
  False
  >>> posubmission.id
  1

And we get None when there isn't any POSubmission with the given ID.

  >>> posubmission = posubmissionset.getPOSubmissionByID(100000)
  >>> posubmission is None
  True

= POSubmission =

This class links the translations submitted by a translator with the associated.

== destroySelf ==

With this method, we allow to remove a submission, it comes from SQLObject,
but we test it here to be sure it appears in our public interface.

We will need extra permissions to use this method.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.harness import LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup
    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup(dbuser='rosettaadmin').setUp()

Select an existing IPOSubmission and try to remove it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POSubmission
    >>> posubmission = POSubmission.get(1)
    >>> posubmission.destroySelf()

It should not exist now.

    >>> posubmission = POSubmission.get(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SQLObjectNotFound:...

    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup().tearDown()
