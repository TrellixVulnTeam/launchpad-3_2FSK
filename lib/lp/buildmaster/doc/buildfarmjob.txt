BuildFarmJob provides a basic implementation of IBuildFarmJob.  The
specific build farm job classes should delegate to it.

    >>> buildfarmjob = BuildFarmJob()
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJob, buildfarmjob)
    True

BuildFarmJobDelegate exists to encapsulate the functionality required
by classes delegating IBuildFarmJob. This class also includes
the getByJob() class method used to find the instance of a specific
build-farm job implementation associated with a given Job instance.

    >>> from lp.buildmaster.interfaces.buildfarmjob import (
    ...     IBuildFarmJobDelegate)
    >>> verifyObject(IBuildFarmJobDelegate, BuildFarmJobDelegate())
    True

XXX The above should be in a unit-test, it is not good documentation.
