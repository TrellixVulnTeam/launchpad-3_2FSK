When displaying the comments on the main bug page they are truncated if
they are too long. In order to show that, let's set the limit to a
small value.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> OLD_COMMENT_SIZE = config.malone.max_comment_size
    >>> config.malone.max_comment_size = 45

Bug number two starts with a short comment followed by two longer ones,
the first one will be displayed as it is, and the other two will be
truncated.

    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/bugs/2')
    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> def print_comments(page):
    ...     """Print all the comments on the page."""
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
    ...     comment_divs = soup('div', 'boardCommentBody')
    ...     for div_tag in comment_divs:
    ...         print div_tag
    >>> print_comments(browser.contents) #doctest: -ELLIPSIS
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <div style="font-family: monospace;"><p>This would be a real killer feature. If there...</p></div>
    <p>
    <a href="http://localhost/ubuntu-product/+bug/2/comments/1">Read more...</a>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <div style="font-family: monospace;"><p>Oddly enough the bug system seems only capabl...</p></div>
    <p>
    <a href="http://localhost/ubuntu-product/+bug/2/comments/2">Read more...</a>
    </p>
    </div>

Let's click on the first "Read more..." link.

    >>> browser.getLink("Read more...").click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://localhost/ubuntu-product/+bug/2/comments/1'

The whole comment is visible on this page:

    >>> print_comments(browser.contents) #doctest: -ELLIPSIS
    <div class="boardCommentBody">
    <div style="font-family: monospace;"><p>This would be a real killer feature. If there is already code
      to make it possible, why aren't there tons of press announcements
      about the secuirty possibilities. Imagine - no more embarrassing
      emails for Mr Gates... everything they delete would actually
      disappear! I'm sure Redmond will switch over as soon as they hear
      about this. It's not a bug, it's a feature!</p></div>
    </div>

    >>> config.malone.max_comment_size = OLD_COMMENT_SIZE
