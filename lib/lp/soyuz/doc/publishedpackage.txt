IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease.meta_binaries returns a list of unique
binaries resulting from the sourcepackagerelease for a distroseries.
The source package mozilla-firefox has two unique binaries:
"mozilla-firefox-data" and "mozilla-firefox". Although the latter
is published twice in two architectures it is only returned once.
