Specifications
==============

A feature specification is a document that describes an idea for an
enhancement to a product. Launchpad allows you to register your
specification and then walk it through the approval process. You can have
specifications for products, and also for distributions.

All Milestone creation and retrieval is done through IMilestoneSet.
IMilestoneSet can be accessed as a utility.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISpecificationSet
    >>> specset = getUtility(ISpecificationSet)

To create a new Specification, use ISpecificationSet.new:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> upstream_firefox = productset.get(4)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import SpecificationPriority
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import SpecificationStatus
    >>> sabdfl = Person.byName('sabdfl')
    >>> newspec = specset.new('mng', 'Support MNG Format', 'http://www.silly.me/SpecName', 'we really need this', SpecificationPriority.EMERGENCY, SpecificationStatus.APPROVED, sabdfl, product=upstream_firefox)
    >>> print newspec.name
    mng

A specification could be attached to a distribution, or a product. We call
this the specification target.

    >>> print newspec.target.name
    firefox
