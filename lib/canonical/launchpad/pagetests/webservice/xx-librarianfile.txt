Salgado starts out with a link to a mugshot, but no actual mugshot.

    >>> salgado = webservice.get('/beta/~salgado').jsonBody()
    >>> salgado['mugshot_link']
    u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado/mugshot'

    >>> salgado_mugshot = '/beta/~salgado/mugshot'
    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...

We can upload a mugshot for salgado with PUT.

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/gif', 'image #1')
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

Once the mugshot has been uploaded, sending a GET to the web
service's mugshot URL will result in a redirect to the mugshot on the
public Internet.

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://localhost:58000/90/mugshot


PUT is also used to modify a mugshot.

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/png', 'image #2')
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

The new mugshot is available at a different URL.

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://localhost:58000/91/mugshot


Deleting a mugshot (with DELETE) disables the redirect.

    >>> print webservice.delete(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...
