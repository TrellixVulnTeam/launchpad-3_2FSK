= Sample data setup =

In order to run Soyuz locally on a development system, the sample data
must be cleaned up and customized a bit.  This is done by a the script
utilities/soyuz-sampledata-setup.py.

We only need this script for the playground sample data, so there's
little point in inspecting what it does to the test database in detail.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.script import run_script

The --dry-run option makes the script roll back its changes.

    >>> return_code, output, error = run_script(
    ...     'utilities/soyuz-sampledata-setup.py', args=['--dry-run'])

    >>> print return_code
    0

    >>> print error
    INFO ...
    INFO Done.
