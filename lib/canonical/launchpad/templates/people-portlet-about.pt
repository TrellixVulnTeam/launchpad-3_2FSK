  <h2>About these profiles</h2>

  <div class="portletBody portletContent">

    <img alt="" src="/@@/info" /> Launchpad profiles are based on actual
    usage of Launchpad, as well as information available from public sources
    such as bug trackers, mailing lists, public key servers and published
    application translations.  You can manage your account in the Launchpad,
    and you can create teams of people who can be maintainers, translators,
    members, clubs... almost any kind of grouping you need.
