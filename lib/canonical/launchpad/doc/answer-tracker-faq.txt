== IFAQTarget ==

The Answer Tracker offers feature to manage answers to commonly asked
questions (also called FAQ). Like the regular questions, FAQ documents
are associated to distributions or products. The IFAQTarget interface
is provided by objects that can host FAQs.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IFAQTarget)

    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')

    # removeSecurityProxy() is needed because not all interface
    # attributes are available to everybody.
    >>> verifyObject(IFAQTarget, removeSecurityProxy(firefox))
    True

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> verifyObject(IFAQTarget, removeSecurityProxy(ubuntu))
    True

Any user who has 'launchpad.Moderate' on the project can create a new
FAQ. (That permission is granted to project's registrant and answer
contacts.)

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> print firefox.owner.displayname
    Sample Person

    >>> firefox_faq = firefox.newFAQ(
    ...     sample_person, 'How can I see the Fnords',
    ...     'Describe installation of the Fnords highlighter extension.',
    ...     content="Install the extension and see the Fnords!")

(The complete description of the IFAQTarget is available in
lib/canonical/launchpad/interfaces/ftests/faqtarget.txt)
