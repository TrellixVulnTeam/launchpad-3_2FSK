= Featured Projects =

We show a few key projects on the Launchpad home page. These are projects
that are either topical, or high profile, or making very good use of
Launchpad, so we want to draw attention to them. The list of projects is
stored in the FeaturedProject table, and managed through the PillarNameSet.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IPillarNameSet, IProductSet, IProjectSet
    ...     )
    >>> pillar_set = getUtility(IPillarNameSet)
    >>> def isFeatured(project):
    ...     return project in getUtility(IPillarNameSet).featured_projects

We can get a list of featured projects from the pillar name set:

    >>> for project in pillar_set.featured_projects:
    ...     print project.name
    applets
    bazaar
    firefox
    gentoo
    gnome
    gnome-terminal
    mozilla
    thunderbird
    ubuntu

We'll make sure our isFeatured() test is working:

    >>> isFeatured(getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('bazaar'))
    True
    >>> isFeatured(getUtility(IProjectSet).getByName('gnome'))
    True
    >>> isFeatured(getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu'))
    True
    >>> isFeatured(getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('kubuntu'))
    False


We can add a project, product or distro to the list of featured projects:

    >>> guadalinex = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('guadalinex')
    >>> isFeatured(guadalinex)
    False
    >>> added = pillar_set.add_featured_project(guadalinex)
    >>> isFeatured(guadalinex)
    True

    >>> evolution = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')
    >>> isFeatured(evolution)
    False
    >>> added = pillar_set.add_featured_project(evolution)
    >>> isFeatured(evolution)
    True

    >>> apache = getUtility(IProjectSet).getByName('apache')
    >>> isFeatured(apache)
    False
    >>> added = pillar_set.add_featured_project(apache)
    >>> isFeatured(apache)
    True

And we can remove them, too:
