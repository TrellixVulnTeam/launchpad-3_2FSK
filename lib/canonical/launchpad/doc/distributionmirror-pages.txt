== Reviewing a distribution mirror ==

This page allows mirror admins to set the status of a given mirror.  The
status can be PENDING_REVIEW, UNOFFICIAL and OFFICIAL.  When the status is
changed we also store the person who changed it and the date it was changed.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import LaunchpadFormHarness
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.browser import DistributionMirrorReviewView
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionMirrorSet
    >>> mirror = getUtility(IDistributionMirrorSet).getByName(
    ...     'canonical-archive')
    >>> print mirror.status.name
    OFFICIAL
    >>> print mirror.date_reviewed, mirror.reviewer
    None None

If the status is not changed, the reviewer and date_reviewed won't be
changed either.

    >>> login('karl@canonical.com')
    >>> harness = LaunchpadFormHarness(mirror, DistributionMirrorReviewView)
    >>> harness.submit('save', {'field.status': mirror.status.name})
    >>> print mirror.status.name
    OFFICIAL
    >>> print mirror.date_reviewed, mirror.reviewer
    None None

When the status is changed, though, both reviewer and date_reviewed are
changed.

    >>> harness.submit('save', {'field.status': 'UNOFFICIAL'})
    >>> print mirror.status.name
    UNOFFICIAL
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> print mirror.date_reviewed.date() == datetime.today().date()
    True
    >>> print mirror.reviewer.name
    karl
