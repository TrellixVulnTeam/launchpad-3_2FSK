If a branch fails to mirror, that information is displayed in the mirror's
page, together with the last failure message we got when mirroring.

>>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~jblack/+junk/devel-1.0')
>>> content = anon_browser.contents
>>> mirror_failure_tag = find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
>>> print extract_text(mirror_failure_tag)
Launchpad could not mirror this branch on 2006-04-08.
The error was:
I do not like Arch, so I am pretending it failed to mirror.

If a branch failed to mirror but no failure message was stored, we properly
report the absence of an error message.

>>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~stevea/thunderbird/main')
>>> content = anon_browser.contents
>>> mirror_failure_tag = find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
>>> print extract_text(mirror_failure_tag)
Launchpad could not mirror this branch on 2006-04-08.
No error message was recorded.

Ultimately, if a branch was successfully mirrored, then we obviously won't
display any failure-related information.

>>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/2.6')
>>> content = anon_browser.contents
>>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
None
