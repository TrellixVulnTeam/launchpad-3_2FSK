    <img alt="" src="/@@/info" /> The launchpad Friend-Of-A-Friend
    system is a way of seeing how you are active in the open source world.
    You can manage your account in the Launchpad, and you can create teams
    of people who can be maintainers, translators, members, clubs... almost
    any kind of grouping you need.
