Let's take a tour of the Launchpad specification management system.

First, we should be able to see a list of latest specs on any product or
distribution in Launchpad. This should take the form of a portlet on the
product or distribution home page, showing latest specs.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> main = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(main).encode('us-ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    Mozilla Firefox...
    Latest blueprints
    Merge Open Browser Windows with "Consolidate Windows"
    Support E4X in EcmaScript
    Support Native SVG Objects
    Support &lt;canvas&gt; Objects
    Extension Manager Upgrades...

If there are no specifications, then we should not see the "latest
specifications" portlet.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/debian')
    >>> main = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> text = extract_text(main).encode('us-ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    >>> print text
    Debian GNU/Linux...
    Uses Launchpad for:
    Nothing...
    >>> 'Latest blueprints' not in text
    True

On both product and distribution we should be able to see a list of
specifications, at +specs.

First, let's check on product.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /evolution/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Now, on distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /debian/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...


And we should see the latest specifications available for the whole system:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /specs/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Recently registered...


Which should also support searching:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /specs/?searchtext=svg HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...blueprint(s) matching...svg...
  ...Support Native SVG Objects...
