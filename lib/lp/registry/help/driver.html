    <h1>What is a project driver?</h1>

    <p>
      The project driver is a person or team who is responsible for setting
      the direction for the project.  The driver can set goals, approve bug
      targeting, or set backporting for <b>any</b> major series in the
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can chose to leave the project driver unset and
      appoint a team for each series.
