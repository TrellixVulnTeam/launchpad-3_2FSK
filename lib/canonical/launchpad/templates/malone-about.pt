    <h1>About Malone</h1>

        <p>Malone is a collaborative bug tracker. It is unique, in that it
        understands that open source code is worked on by upstream
        contributors as well as by distributions, and that both will want to
        track their bugs separately, but also share that bug information.
        Malone allows you to file a bug on a packge in Gentoo, for example,
        and then easily tell the upstream maintainers about the bug. Someone
        else can then say "hey, this bug is fixed in Ubuntu", at which point
        upstream and Gentoo both see the fix.</p>

        <p>In Malone we separate out the information about a specific bug,
        and the tracking of where that bug occurs. Everybody shares the
        information about the bug - it's description, summary, links to
        relevant web content and other bug trackers. But tracking the status
        of that bug is done separately for upstream aand for each fo the
        distributions. This means that a Malone Bug is a bit of a
        Heisenbug... the status of the bug depends on your viewpoint. If you
        are looking at the bug from within a distribution, you will see the
        status of that bug in your distribution. If you are from upstream,
        you will see the bug status upstream. You can of course also see the
        status elsewhere, especially if "elsewhere" has fixed this bug.</p>

        <p>Malone also introduces a new concept in bug tracking, which is
        "infestation". Bug infestation is a way of tracking the state of a
        bug in a specific release of the upstream code, or distro packages.
        So its possible with Malone to say "this bug exists in that version,
        but not in this version". If you can point at a specific version
        which fixes the bug, then that information will be highlighted for
        everyone. This allows a fix developed in one of the distributions to
        propagate quickly upstream, and to the other distros.</p>

    <h2>Start Using Malone</h2>

        <p>You can start using Malone as a bug tracker immediately, for any
        open source project. Simply <a href="products">find your open source
        project in the Launchpad</a>, and start filing bugs. You can add
        your project to the Launchpad trivially if it's not already listed.
        You can discuss Malone itself with other users on the <a
        href="http://lists.ubuntulinux.org/mailman/listinfo/malone-users">Malone-Users
        List </a>, where we discuss new features, bugs and
        other issues related to Malone.</p>
