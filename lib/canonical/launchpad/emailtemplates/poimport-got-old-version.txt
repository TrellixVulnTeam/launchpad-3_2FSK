Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with
%(language)s translations for %(template)s in Rosetta.

We didn't import it because you didn't update its header to note
the time stamp when you added your translations.

To fix this problem, please upload again this file with the
'PO-Revision-Date' field updated.

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:
%(file_link)s

Thanks for using Rosetta.
