      <h2>Current Base Language Pack</h2>
      <p>
        A base language pack is the one that includes all files with
        translations available in
        <tal:distribution replace="view/displayname" /> relase.

        <tal:distribution replace="view/displayname" /> release's base
        language pack export was done.

      <h2>Current Language Pack being tested</h2>
      <p>
        A language pack being tested is one that is in the process to become
        either a new base one or a delta one for
        <tal:distribution replace="view/displayname" /> release. It depends on
        the type of language pack to know which one will become.
