Rejecting and Reopening
=======================

There should be a link to allow the rejection of an open ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Reject...

There is a page to allow us to reject a ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+reject HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

When we POST that back to the ticket page we should see a status of
rejected, and a message saying that it has been rejected. And the Actions
portlet should allow us to Reopen the ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 20
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... reject=Reject""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...You have rejected this request...
  ...+reopen">Reopen Request</a>...
  ...Rejected...

The reopening page should be visible.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+reopen HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

POSTIng that form should make the status Open, and give a portal message to
say that the ticket was reopened. In addition, we should see the reopenings
portlet, listing a single instance of reopening by Foo Bar. And finally, we
should see the "Show History" action item.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 20
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... reopen=Reopen+Ticket""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...You have reopened this request...
  ...+reject">Reject Request</a>...
  ...Open...
  ...This request was reopened:...

The +history page should be visible for this ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+history HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
