Launchpad: Values
=================

Whenever we are thinking about what Launchpad should be, or how we should
implement a change, or whether something is a good idea or not, we have
recourse to two distinct sets of guidelines.

The first is the Launchpad Vision <vision>.  It can help us answer questions
such as, "Is this in scope?", "How does this help Launchpad meet its goals?".
It tries to sort out the 'matter' of Launchpad.

The second is this document, the Launchpad Values.  It tries to address the
'manner' of Launchpad.  It, perhaps, will not answer specific questions for
you.  Rather, it will rule out certain options and decisions before they are
even considered.

Like the Vision, this document is living: it should be changed and improved as
we learn more about how to make Launchpad.  It is also aspirational: not all
of Launchpad lives up to these values.


Better tools help
=================

Launchpad is fundamentally based on the principle that improving the tools
that we use to make things will help us make better things than we could
before and indeed make better things more cheaply than we could before.

Launchpad should be that "better tool" and be always aiming to smooth and
accelerate the process of making software.


Invisible.  If not, fun.
========================

Launchpad is a tool to help busy people get important stuff done.  It should
stay out of the way where possible.  Bugs, OOPSes, downtime and slowness all
draw attention to Launchpad and away from the interesting problems that our
users are trying to solve.

Where it is not possible to stay out of the way, Launchpad should be fun to
use.  We make next actions obvious and draw attention to users' achievements.


Reveal opportunities
====================

One of the grand things about open source software is that it is open to
contributions from total strangers.

Launchpad makes those contributions possible by removing as many barriers as
possible to contribution, and highlights areas where contributions would be
especially welcome.


Collaboration occurs between people
===================================

It is sometimes easy to forget that all of the code, bugs, translations,
packages and whatever else that's in Launchpad are made by actual human
beings.

These human beings are deeply interested in themselves and in other human
beings.

Not our data
============

The data in Launchpad does not really belong to us, we are merely its
stewards.  We make sure that users can get their data easily and that they can
change it as they see fit.


Cross-project consistency
=========================

If you know how to contribute to one project on Launchpad, you ought to be
able to quickly and painlessly contribute to any other project on Launchpad.
Or, if you can't, it won't be Launchpad's fault.


All of open source
==================

Any open source project ought to be able to host itself on Launchpad.  We do
not enforce workflows, rather we allow people to fit their project's existing
workflow into Launchpad.

However, when we can, we encourage people toward best practices.  After all,
we want to make open source software better.


Full circle
===========

Something magical happens when a feature or a workflow reaches all the way
back to where it began.

Being able to attach patches to bugs is great, but it's not good enough until
developers can easily *find* those patches.  Finding the patches is only good
enough when you can merge, comment and reject those patches.

Likewise, importing translations from an upstream is great, but it becomes
much, much better when those translations can be improved in Launchpad and
then sent back to the upstream.
