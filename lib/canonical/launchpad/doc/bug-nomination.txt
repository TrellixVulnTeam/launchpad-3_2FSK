Bug Nomination
==============

Any logged-in user can nominate a bug to be fixed in a specific
distribution release or product series. Nominations are created by
calling IBug.addNomination.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBugSet, IDistributionSet, IPersonSet)

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> bug_one = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("ubuntu")
    >>> ubuntu_hoary = ubuntu.getRelease("hoary")
    >>> foo_bar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("name16")

    >>> hoary_nomination = bug_one.addNomination(
    ...     distrorelease=ubuntu_hoary, owner=foobar)

The nomination records the distro release or series for which the bug
was nominated, the user that submitted the nomination (the "owner".)
