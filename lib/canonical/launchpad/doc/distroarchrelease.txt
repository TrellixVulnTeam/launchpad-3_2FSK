Distro Arch Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.distroarchrelease import (
  ...     DistroArchRelease)
  >>> hoary_i386 = DistroArchRelease.get(6)

XXX: This needs many more tests to be effective.

Distro Arch Releases can tell you about their published releases.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distro Arch Releases have a number of releases of any given binary
package in them. This can be due to various reasons such as uploads in
progress, superseding in progress, or simply that there is more than
one version spread across the pockets. getReleasedPackages lets us
interrogate this information.

   >>> for p in hoary_i386.getReleasedPackages("pmount"):
   ...     print p.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name
   pmount


DistroArchRelease class has a built-in method to return a single 
dependency package candidate by its name as a PublishedPackage 
instance:

   >>> hoary_i386.findDepCandidateByName("pmount").binarypackagename
   u'pmount'

Since 'at' isn't available in our sampledata (not even published), 
None is returned:

   >>> assert hoary_i386.findDepCandidateByName("at") is None
