= Products with code =

The main purpose of this page is to show to casual browsers (and robots) that
there are branches associated with products, and to entice them to click
through to get lists of branches of products that interest them.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev')
    >>> browser.getLink('5 projects').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Projects with active branches

This page hangs off the launchpad root site.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/+project-cloud')
    >>> print browser.title
    Projects with active branches

    >>> contents = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'container')
    >>> for anchor in contents.fetch('a'):
    ...     print anchor['href']
