Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with
%(language)s translations for %(template)s in Rosetta.

We didn't import it because you didn't get it from Rosetta or
you removed the tag we put in the files exported from Rosetta.

The reason to require that Rosetta tag is to prevent people doing
offline translations from inadvertently reverting translations done
by others.

To fix that problem, please get latest export from Rosetta, apply
your changes and upload the merged file.

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:
%(file_link)s

Thanks for using Rosetta.
