= ImageUpload widget =

In Launchpad we have images associated with people, products, distributions,
etc, and we want to allow people to have full control over their images. That
is, they must be able to upload a new image and delete (or keep) an existing 
one. For this we created this widget, which can be embeded into any form we 
want, which doesn't require us to add any submit buttons to indicate that the
image should be kept, deleted or changed.

The widget is composed by a RadioWidget and a FileWidget, where the radio
specifies the action that should be performed (keep the existing image, change
back to the default image or change it to an user-uploaded one) and the
FileWidget gives us the user-uploaded file, in case there is one.

Let's use Salgado as an example here, since he hasn't uploaded a hackergotchi
yet.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPerson, IPersonSet
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> salgado.gotchi is None
    True

== The ImageUpload widget ==

Since Salgado has no hackergotchi, the widget will display the default
no-hackergotchi image and the 'Keep' radio button will be selected. The
other radio button allows the user to upload a new image.

    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
    >>> from canonical.widgets.image import ImageUploadWidget
    >>> person_gotchi = IPerson['gotchi'].bind(salgado)
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest())

    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> html = widget()
    >>> print BeautifulSoup(html).find('img').get('src')
    /@@/nyet-mugshot

    >>> def print_radio_items(html):
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    ...     for input in soup('input', {'type': 'radio'}):
    ...         item = input.get('value')
    ...         if input.get('checked'):
    ...             item += ': SELECTED'
    ...         else:
    ...             item += ': NOT SELECTED'
    ...         print item
    >>> print_radio_items(html)
    keep: SELECTED
    change: NOT SELECTED


If we set any random file as salgado's hackergotchi, we'll see it there, as
well as an option to delete the image that was just uploaded.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILibraryFileAliasSet
    >>> login('guilherme.salgado@canonical.com')
    >>> mugshot = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[53]
    >>> salgado.gotchi = mugshot

    # Need to create a new widget instance since we changed our context
    # manually.
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest())

    >>> html = widget()
    >>> mugshot.secure_url == BeautifulSoup(html).find('img').get('src')
    True

    >>> print_radio_items(html)
    keep: SELECTED
    delete: NOT SELECTED
    change: NOT SELECTED


Now we'll stuff values in our request to simulate a user playing with the
widget. Let's see how it reacts.

First, let's tell it to keep the existing image.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import KEEP_SAME_IMAGE
    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'keep'}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue() == KEEP_SAME_IMAGE
    True

Then we tell it to delete the existing one.

    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'delete'}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue() is None
    True

And now we change it to a random image.

    >>> import canonical.launchpad
    >>> import os
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> mugshot_file_name = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...     'pagetests/standalone/mypng.png')
    >>> mugshot = StringIO(open(mugshot_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'mypng.png'
    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.gotchi.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    'mypng.png'
    >>> fileupload.seek(0)
    >>> len(fileupload.read()) == mugshot.len
    True


== The BaseImageUpload field ==

Note that since this is a special widget which returns a special object
(KEEP_SAME_IMAGE) to indicate that the image should be kept, we need to use
a custom field (BaseImageUpload) together with it. That field should not be
used directly, since it specifies some constraints and defaults that are
specific to each image, so you must subclass it before using.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import BaseImageUpload
    >>> isinstance(person_gotchi, BaseImageUpload)
    True
    >>> person_gotchi.__class__ != BaseImageUpload
    True
    >>> person_gotchi.max_size
    102400
    >>> person_gotchi.max_dimensions
    (200, 200)

If we pass that special object (KEEP_SAME_IMAGE) to BaseImageUpload's set()
method, the current image will be kept.

    >>> existing_img = salgado.gotchi
    >>> existing_img is None
    False

    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, KEEP_SAME_IMAGE)
    >>> salgado.gotchi == existing_img
    True

On the other hand, if we pass None, the current image will be removed.

    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, None)
    >>> salgado.gotchi is None
    True

Similarly, passing any file of the type expected (FileUpload) will
change the current image to the given file.

    >>> fileupload.seek(0)
    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, fileupload)
    >>> salgado.gotchi is None
    False
    >>> salgado.gotchi == existing_img
    False


== Input validation ==

The BaseImageUpload field expects an image under the given size/dimension
constraints, so it won't accept anything else.

Here we have an image with a byte size smaller than person_gotchi.max_size and
dimensions also smaller than person_gotchi.max_dimensions, so it must be
accepted.

    >>> mugshot_file_name = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...     'pagetests/standalone/big.png')
    >>> mugshot = StringIO(open(mugshot_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'big.png'
    >>> mugshot.len <= person_gotchi.max_size
    True
    >>> import PIL.Image
    >>> image = PIL.Image.open(mugshot)
    >>> image.size <= person_gotchi.max_dimensions
    True

    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'change', 'field.gotchi.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    'big.png'
    >>> fileupload.seek(0)
    >>> len(fileupload.read()) == mugshot.len
    True

If we change person_gotchi's max_size to be smaller than our test image, we'll
get a validation error.

    >>> person_gotchi.max_size = mugshot.len - 1
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.gotchi', u'Hackergotchi',
                       This image exceeds the maximum allowed size in bytes.)

A similar error will be raised if the image's dimensions are bigger than the
maximun we allow.

    >>> person_gotchi.max_size = mugshot.len
    >>> person_gotchi.max_dimensions = (image.size[0] - 1, image.size[1] + 1)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.gotchi', u'Hackergotchi',
                       This image exceeds the maximum allowed width or height
                       in pixels.)

    >>> person_gotchi.max_dimensions = (image.size[0] + 1, image.size[1] - 1)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.gotchi', u'Hackergotchi',
                       This image exceeds the maximum allowed width or height
                       in pixels.)

We also won't accept anything that is not an image; that is, we only accept
what can be parsed by the Python Imaging Library module.

    >>> mugshot = StringIO('foo bar bz')
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'foo.jpg'
    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'change', 'field.gotchi.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.gotchi', u'Hackergotchi',
                       The file uploaded was not recognized as an image;
                       please check it and retry.)

Finally, if the user specifies the 'change' action he must also provide a file
to be uploaded.

    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'change', 'field.gotchi.image': ''}
    >>> widget = ImageUploadWidget(person_gotchi, TestRequest(form=form))
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.gotchi', u'Hackergotchi',
                       Please specify the image you want to use.)
