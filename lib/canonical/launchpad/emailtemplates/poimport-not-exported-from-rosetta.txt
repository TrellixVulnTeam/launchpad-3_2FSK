Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with %(language)s translations for %(template)s in Launchpad.

We were unable to import it because either this file did not originate in Launchpad, or you removed the tag we use to mark files exported from Launchpad.

The reason we require that tag is to prevent translators who work offline from inadvertently reverting translations made by others.

To fix the problem, please get the latest export from Launchpad, apply your changes and upload the merged file.

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:
%(file_link)s

Thank you,

The Launchpad team
