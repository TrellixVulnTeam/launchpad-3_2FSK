Bugs in Malone
==============

This document describes what a Bug is in Malone, and provides some (currently
rather incomplete) info on how to poke at bugs through the Component
Architecture.

Working with Bugs
=================

Bugs are created and retrieved via IBugSet.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bugset = getUtility(IBugSet)

To demonstrate how to retrieve a specific bug, let's simulate that we're
interacting with the system as an anonymous user:

    >>> import zope.security.management
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login("launchpad.anonymous")

To retrieve a specific Bug, use IBugSet.get:

    >>> firefox_crashes = bugset.get(6)
    >>> print firefox_crashes.title
    Firefox crashes when Save As dialog for a nonexistent window is closed

Bug Privacy
===========

A Bug has a "private" field. If Bug.private is False, the bug is publicly
visible. If Bug.private is True, only people who are explicitly subscribed to
the bug can see it.

Marking Bugs Private
--------------------

For the purposes of demonstration, we should make this bug private. A bug
cannot be made private by an anonymous user.

    >>> firefox_crashes.private = True
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ('private', 'launchpad.AnyPerson')

We have to be logged in, so let's do that (or pretend to do that, anyway :):

    >>> login("test@canonical.com")

Now we can toggle the privacy flag on a bug, but before we do, let's note what
happens to subscriptions on a bug before and after it's marked private. So,
there are currently no explicit subscripitions to this bug.

    >>> print firefox_crashes.subscriptions
    []

The maintainer is "implicitly" subscribed to the bug. However, the rule with
private bugs is that only explicit subscribers can view the bug after it's been
marked private. So, when we mark bug #15 private:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event.sqlobjectevent import SQLObjectModifiedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> def capture_state(obj, *fields):
    ...     class State: pass
    ...     state = State()
    ...     for field in fields:
    ...         setattr(state, field, getattr(obj, field))
    ...     return state

    >>> old_state = capture_state(
    ...     firefox_crashes, "id", "title", "private")
    >>> firefox_crashes.private = True
    >>> bug_set_private = SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     firefox_crashes, old_state,
    ...     ["id", "title", "private"],
    ...     getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12))
    >>> notify(bug_set_private)

The maintainer is automatically explicitly subscribed.

    >>> people_ids_subscribed = [
    ...     subscription.person.id
    ...     for subscription in list(firefox_crashes.subscriptions)]
    >>> people_ids_subscribed.sort()
    >>> print people_ids_subscribed
    [12]

Filing Public vs. Private Bugs
------------------------------

For the purposes of illustration, let's pretend we're logged in as the user Foo
Bar:

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

When a public bug is filed:

>>> from zope.app.event.objectevent import ObjectCreatedEvent
>>> from canonical.launchpad.database.bug import BugFactory
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
>>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
>>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
>>> bugset = getUtility(IBugSet)

>>> firefox = productset.get(4)
>>> foobar = personset.get(16)
>>> added_bug = BugFactory(
...     product = firefox, title = "test firefox bug",
...     comment = "blah blah blah", owner = foobar)
>>> notify(ObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> public_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)

the submitter is explicitly subscribed. The maintainer is considered implicitly
subscribed:

>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in public_bug.subscriptions]
[16]

But when a private bug is filed:

>>> added_bug = BugFactory(
...     product = firefox, title = "test firefox bug",
...     comment = "blah blah blah", owner = foobar,
...     private = True)
>>> notify(ObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> private_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)

both the submitter and the maintainer are explicitly subscribed:

>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in private_bug.subscriptions]
[12, 16]

to ensure that both the submitter and maintainer can actually see the bug that
was filed!

Note that this works similarly for distributions; in this case the
"maintainer" is considered the person who maintains the applicable
sourcepackage. E.g.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet, \
...     ISourcePackageNameSet
>>> distributionset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
>>> spnset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
>>> ubuntu = distributionset.get(1)
>>> evolution = spnset.get(9)
>>> added_bug = BugFactory(
...     distribution = ubuntu.id, sourcepackagename = evolution,
...     title = "test firefox bug", comment = "blah blah blah",
...     owner = foobar, private = True)
>>> notify(ObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> private_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)
>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in private_bug.subscriptions]
[1, 16]
