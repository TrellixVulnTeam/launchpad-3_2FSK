= Project and the Support Tracker =

Although ticket cannot be filed directly against projects, IProject in
Launchpad also provides the ITicketCollection and
ISearchableByTicketOwner interfaces.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IProjectSet, ISearchableByTicketOwner, ITicketCollection)

    >>> mozilla_project = getUtility(IProjectSet).getByName('mozilla')
    >>> verifyObject(ITicketCollection, mozilla_project)
    True
    >>> verifyObject(ISearchableByTicketOwner, mozilla_project)
    True

== searchTickets() ==

This means that it is possible to search for all tickets filed against
products in a project using the project searchTickets() method.

    # Add a ticket to thunderbird.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag, IProductSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> thunderbird = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('thunderbird')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ticket = thunderbird.newTicket(
    ...     sample_person, "SVG attachments aren't displayed",
    ...     "It would be a nice feature if SVG attachments could be displayed"
    ...     "inlined.")

    >>> for ticket in mozilla_project.searchTickets(search_text='svg'):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.target.displayname
    SVG attachments aren't displayed            Mozilla Thunderbird
    Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site    Mozilla Firefox

Tickets can be searched by all the standard searchTickets() parameters
(consult tickettarget.txt for the full details.)

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TicketStatus, TicketSort
    >>> for ticket in mozilla_project.searchTickets(
    ...     owner=sample_person, status=TicketStatus.OPEN,
    ...     sort=TicketSort.OLDEST_FIRST):
    ...     print ticket.title, ticket.target.displayname
    Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site    Mozilla Firefox
    SVG attachments aren't displayed            Mozilla Thunderbird

== getTicketLanguages() ==

The getTicketLanguages() returns the set of languages that is used by
all the tickets in the project products.

    >>> sorted(language.code
    ...        for language in mozilla_project.getTicketLanguages())
    [u'en', u'pt_BR']

(The firefox product has one ticket created in Brazilian Portuguese.)
