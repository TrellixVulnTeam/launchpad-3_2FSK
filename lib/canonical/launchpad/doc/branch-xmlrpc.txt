== register_branch ==

register_branch(branch_url, branch_name, branch_title,
                branch_description, author_email, product_name)

Let's register a branch using register_branch(). First we make sure that
there is no branch with the URL we are going to register.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
    >>> branch_url = 'http://foo.com/branch'
    >>> getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUrl(branch_url) is None
    True

The only thing that we have to supply is the branch url. The rest is
optional, so we pass '' for the rest of the parameters. The reason we
pass '' is that XMLRPC doesn't allow optional parameters, and None is an
extension to XMLRPC which we don't want to rely on. We use the currently
authenticated user as the owner of the branch.

    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      'http://foo.com/branch', '', '', '', '', '')
    'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name16/+junk/branch'

Now we can see that a branch got registered:

    >>> new_branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUrl(branch_url)

The author and owner got set to the authenticated person; Foo Bar.

    >>> print new_branch.author.displayname
    Foo Bar
    >>> print new_branch.owner.displayname
    Foo Bar

The name got set to the last component of the URL since it wasn't
specified:

    >>> print new_branch.name
    branch

Since we didn't specify product, title or description, they are None:

    >>> new_branch.product is None
    True
    >>> new_branch.title is None
    True
    >>> new_branch.summary is None
    True

Also, Launchpad is scheduled to mirror this branch on its next mirror run:

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(new_branch).sync()
    >>> print new_branch.next_mirror_time is not None
    True
    >>> print new_branch.next_mirror_time < datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    True

(We remove the security proxy in order to ensure that next_mirror_time has a
real object in it, rather than an expression builder.)

Let's register a branch specifying the name, description and product as
well:

    >>> other_branch_url = 'http://foo.com/other_branch'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      other_branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name16/evolution/branch_name'

    >>> new_branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUrl(other_branch_url)
    >>> print new_branch.owner.displayname
    Foo Bar
    >>> print new_branch.author.displayname
    Sample Person

    >>> print new_branch.name
    branch_name
    >>> print new_branch.title
    branch_title
    >>> print new_branch.product.displayname
    Evolution

If we try to register a branch with a unique name that is already used:

    >>> yet_another_branch_url = 'http://foo.com/yet_another_branch'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      yet_another_branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 130: 'Unique name already in use: ~name16/evolution/branch_name'>

This check must also detect branch name conflict for +junk branches:

    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      yet_another_branch_url, 'branch', '', '', '', '')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 130: 'Unique name already in use: ~name16/+junk/branch'>


If we give a product name that doesn't exist, we get an error:

    >>> new_branch_url = 'http://foo.com/new_branch'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      new_branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'non-existing')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 10: 'No such product: non-existing'>

If we give an email address which isn't registered in Launchpad:

    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      new_branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'non-existing@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 20: 'Invalid author: No user with the email address
                      "non-existing@canonical.com" was found'>

If we try to register a branch with an invalid URI:

    >>> invalid_uri = '.'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     invalid_uri, 'branch_name', 'branch title', 'branch description',
    ...     'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 120: 'Invalid URL: .\n"." is not a valid URI'>

If we try to register a URL with a unsupported scheme:

    >>> bad_scheme = 'svn://chinstrap.ubuntu.com/foo/bar/baz'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     bad_scheme, 'branch_name', 'branch title', 'branch description',
    ...     'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 120: 'Invalid URL: svn://chinstrap.ubuntu.com/foo/bar/baz\nThe URI scheme "svn" is not allowed.  Only URIs with the following schemes may be used: bzr+ssh, ftp, http, https, sftp'>

If we try to register a root URL:

    >>> root_url = 'http://example.com/'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     root_url, 'branch_name', 'branch title', 'branch description',
    ...     'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 120: 'Invalid URL: http://example.com\nURLs for branches cannot point to the root of a site.'>

If we try to register a URL in launchpad.net (actually, launchpad.dev because
we are in the testing environment):

    >>> launchpad_url = 'https://blueprints.launchpad.dev/foo/bar/baz'
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     launchpad_url, 'branch_name', 'branch title', 'branch description',
    ...     'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 120: 'Invalid URL: https://blueprints.launchpad.dev/foo/bar/baz\nFor Launchpad to mirror a branch, the original branch cannot be on <code>launchpad.dev</code>.'>

Registering a branch name that ends in a slash works, but the slash
gets removed from the stored URL:

    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     new_branch_url + '/', 'new_branch', 'branch_title',
    ...     'branch_description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name16/evolution/new_branch'

    >>> new_branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUrl(new_branch_url)
    >>> print new_branch.url
    http://foo.com/new_branch
    >>> print new_branch.owner.name
    name16
    >>> print new_branch.product.name
    evolution
    >>> print new_branch.name
    new_branch


If we try to register a branch which is already registered in Launchpad:

    >>> getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUrl(other_branch_url) is not None
    True
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      other_branch_url, 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 50: 'http://foo.com/other_branch is already registered.'>


We get the same error if we try to register the branch with a slash appended:
    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...      other_branch_url + '/', 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...      'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'evolution')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 50: 'http://foo.com/other_branch is already registered.'>

Attempting to register a branch for a product where the branch visibility
policy is forbidden will cause a fault result.

    >>> branchset_api.register_branch(
    ...     'http://foo.com/bar', 'branch_name', 'branch_title',
    ...     'branch description', 'test@canonical.com', 'landscape')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 110: 'You are not allowed to create a branch for project:
    The Landscape Project'>


== link_branch_to_bug(branch_url, bug_id, whiteboard) ==

link_branch_to_bug() associates a branch with a bug. Let's associate
the branch we registered with bug 1. If the link is successful, the bug
URL is returned.

    >>> branchset_api.link_branch_to_bug(other_branch_url, '1', '')
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/1'

Let's take a look to see that the branch actually got linked to the bug:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bug_one = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)
    >>> for bug_branch in bug_one.bug_branches:
    ...     print "%s, %s, %s" % (
    ...         bug_branch.branch.url, bug_branch.status.title,
    ...         bug_branch.whiteboard)
    http://foo.com/other_branch, Fix In Progress, None

We can set the whiteboard:

    >>> branchset_api.link_branch_to_bug(
    ...     branch_url, 1, "i'm working on it today.")
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/1'
    >>> for bug_branch in bug_one.bug_branches:
    ...     print "%s, %s, %s" % (
    ...         bug_branch.branch.url, bug_branch.status.title,
    ...         bug_branch.whiteboard)
    http://foo.com/other_branch, Fix In Progress, None
    http://foo.com/branch, Fix In Progress, i'm working on it today.

We get an error if we try to specify a non-existant branch or bug:

    >>> branchset_api.link_branch_to_bug('http://foo.com/unknown', '1', '')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 30: 'No such branch: http://foo.com/unknown'>
    >>> branchset_api.link_branch_to_bug(branch_url, '99', '')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 40: 'No such bug: 99'>


== resolve_lp_path ==

The resolve_lp_path API allows clients to retrieve a list of URLs for a
branch by specifying the path component of an lp: URL.

Use of this method by any client other than the 'Launchpad' plugin of
Bazaar is strictly unsupported.

This API is deprecated, and will eventually be replaced with an
equivalent method in the new Launchpad API infrastructure.

Note that authentication is not required to use this method.

    >>> branchset_api = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    ...     'http://xmlrpc.launchpad.dev/bazaar/',
    ...     transport=XMLRPCTestTransport())


On success, resolve_lp_path returns a dict containing a single key,
'urls':

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~vcs-imports/evolution/main')
    >>> print results.keys()
    ['urls']


The value of a key is a list of URLs from which the branch can be
accessed:

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~vcs-imports/evolution/main')
    >>> for url in results['urls']:
    ...     print url
    bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main

The URLs that are likely to be faster or provide write access appear
earlier in the list.


=== lp:project ===

If you specify a path with a single segment, then Launchpad treats that
path as the name of a project, and returns URLs to the branch
associated with the project's development focus series.

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('evolution')
    >>> for url in results['urls']:
    ...     print url
    bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main


Launchpad returns a fault if the development focus doesn't have branch
associated with it.

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('firefox')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 170: 'Series trunk on firefox has no branch associated with it'>


Launchpad also returns a fault if the project doesn't exist.

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('doesntexist')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 10: 'No such product: doesntexist'>


=== lp:project/series ===

If you specify a path with two segments, Launchpad treats that as a
reference to a particular series on a project.

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('evolution/trunk')
    >>> for url in results['urls']:
    ...     print url
    bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main


If the series doesn't exist, then the server returns a fault.

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('firefox/doesntexist')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 180: 'Project firefox has no series called "doesntexist"'>


Similarly if the project doesn't exist:

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('doesntexist/trunk')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 10: 'No such product: doesntexist'>


=== lp:~owner/product/branch ===

Anything longer than two segments is treated as a unique branch name
followed by an arbitrary path:

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~vcs-imports/evolution/main')
    >>> for url in results['urls']:
    ...     print url
    bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main


Launchpad will still resolve the branch even if it doesn't exist:

    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~sabdfl/+junk/doesntexist')
    >>> for url in results['urls']:
    ...     print url
    bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/+junk/doesntexist
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/+junk/doesntexist


But if the project or the user doesn't exist, Launchpad will return a fault:

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~doesntexist/+junk/trunk')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 200: 'No such person: doesntexist'>

    >>> branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~sabdfl/doesntexist/trunk')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 10: 'No such product: doesntexist'>


=== Remote branches ===

Some branches on Launchpad are 'remote' branches. These branches are
not hosted on Launchpad and are only available (if at all) on remote
sites. For these branches, resolve_lp_path returns only a single URL.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (BranchType, IPersonSet)
    >>> arbitrary_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name12')
    >>> getUtility(IBranchSet).new(
    ...     BranchType.REMOTE, 'remote', arbitrary_person, arbitrary_person,
    ...     None, 'http://example.com/remote_branch')
    <Branch u'~name12/+junk/remote' (80)>
    >>> results = branchset_api.resolve_lp_path('~name12/+junk/remote')
    >>> results['urls']
    ['http://example.com/remote_branch']
