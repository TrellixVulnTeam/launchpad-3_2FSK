Now, let's subscribe to the Bounty. First, we want to display the
"subscribe" page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /bounties/mozilla-svg/+subscribe HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Subscribe to Bounty...

Now, let's POST our subscription. The POST should be directed to the
bounty page itself, and we should see a message.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /bounties/mozilla-svg/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... Content-Length: 19
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... subscribe=Subscribe""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Your subscription to this bounty has been updated...
