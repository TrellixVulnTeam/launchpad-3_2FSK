Bug Targets
===========

A bug target is a thing on which a bug can be reported, e.g., an
IDistributionSourcePackage, an IProduct, etc.

Bug Tasks on Bug Targets
------------------------

An IBugTarget provides various attributes for manipulating its
bugtasks. Here are some examples, using Debian mozilla-firefox:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet

    >>> debian = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("debian")
    >>> debian_firefox = debian.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")

Open bugtasks:

    >>> [bugtask.bug.id for bugtask in debian_firefox.open_bugtasks]
    [1, 2, 3]

For the next couple of examples, we'll temporarily modify some bugtask
values to have some sample data for examples following.

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import BugTaskStatus, BugTaskImportance
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugTaskSet
    >>> import transaction

    >>> bug_one_in_debian_firefox = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).get(4)
    >>> bug_two_in_debian_firefox = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).get(5)
    >>> bug_one_in_debian_firefox.importance = BugTaskImportance.CRITICAL
    >>> bug_one_in_debian_firefox.status = BugTaskStatus.INPROGRESS
    >>> bug_two_in_debian_firefox.status = BugTaskStatus.INPROGRESS

    >>> transaction.commit()

Critical bugtasks:

    >>> [bugtask.bug.id for bugtask in debian_firefox.critical_bugtasks]
    [1]

In progress bugtasks:

    >>> [bugtask.bug.id for bugtask in debian_firefox.inprogress_bugtasks]
    [1, 2]

Unassigned bugtasks:

    >>> [bugtask.bug.id for bugtask in debian_firefox.unassigned_bugtasks]
    [1, 3]

All bugtasks ever reported:

    >>> [bugtask.bug.id for bugtask in debian_firefox.all_bugtasks]
    [1, 2, 3, 8]
