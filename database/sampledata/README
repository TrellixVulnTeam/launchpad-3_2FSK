README for Launchpad Sample Data

To update the sample data:

  # go to the db schema directory
  cd database/schema
  # make a database with the current sample data
  make
  # connect to the db, and then do any INSERT or UPDATE commands you need
  psql launchpad_test
  # you could also run a script which updates the data in the way you want
  # now dump a copy of that data to new-sampledata.sql
  # nb this excludes the language, spokenin and country tables which
  # are managed separately in language.sql
  make newsampledata
  # now inspect the new sample data
  less new-sampledata.sql
  # if you like it, make it the current sampledata
  cp new-sampledata.sql current.sql
  # commit your changes
  tla commit -s "updated sample data to include..." (add your comments)
  

Creating sample data is tedious. Very. So to simplify our lives, please
just use the following core items in your sample data. In other words,
only record new sample data that references the following KEY OBJECTS:

  Person:
    12  Sample Person
    17  Ubuntu Team

In other words, we have an example of a person (12) and a team (17).
Please use one or other of these Person's for any new sample data
you create.
