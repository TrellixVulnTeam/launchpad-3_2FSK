Launchpad doesn't need to talk directly to Mailman, but we can still test that
Mailman exists and seems properly configured, and that Launchpad can import
the shared package.  Anything more than that is left to other tests.

    >>> import subprocess, os
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mailman.config import prefix
    >>> def withlist(callable, *options):
    ...     callable_path = 'canonical.launchpad.mailman.tests.' + callable
    ...     args = ' '.join(options)
    ...     site_list = 'unused_mailman_site_list'
    ...     prefix_path = prefix(config.mailman.build_prefix)
    ...     mailman_bin = os.path.join(prefix_path, 'bin')
    ...     command = './withlist %s -r %s %s' % (
    ...         args, callable_path, site_list)
    ...     return subprocess.call(command.split(), cwd=mailman_bin)

Mailman's site list must exist.

    >>> withlist('withlist_1.test_site_list', '-q')
    99

Mailman must also be able to import the shared package.

    >>> withlist('withlist_2.can_import', '-q')
    99
