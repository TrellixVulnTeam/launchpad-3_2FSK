  <p>Launchpad is integrated with the <a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> version control system. (<a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/WhyUseBzr">Why use Bazaar?</a>).</p>

  <p>This page lists all the branches which are related to a person or team.
    A person or team can be related to a branch in several ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>registrant</strong> of a branch is responsible for
      administering this branch. The registrant can edit all the branch
      details. Upload branches can only be modified (with <code>bzr
      push</code>, <code>commit</code>, etc.) by the registrant.</li>

    <li>The <strong>author</strong> is the person being given credit for the
      branch. The author cannot modify the branch in any way, and should
      normally be the same as the registrant. We have both fields to allow
      you to register a branch which is useful for you and the community,
      and which you want to monitor through Launchpad, but for which you
      are not the author.</li>

    <li>A <strong>subscriber</strong> is a person expressing interest in a
      branch. Subscribing to a branch does not give any right, and is only
      useful to link to a branch from a person's page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a person or team is both the <em>registrant</em> and the
    <em>author</em> of a branch, it appears as the <em>author</em>. A person or
    team is presented as the registrant only if the branch has different
    author, or if the author is not specified.</p>
