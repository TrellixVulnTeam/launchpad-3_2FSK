== People ==

Basic operations on people are described in xx-collections.txt. This
document shows some of a person's associated collections and entries.


== Team memberships ==

A person is linked to their team memberships.

  >>> salgado = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/salgado HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> salgado['team_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships'

Similarly, a team is linked to the team memberships of its members.

  >>> landscape_developers = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> landscape_developers['member_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/landscape-developers/member_memberships'

Team memberships are objects with their own URLs and data fields.

  >>> salgado_memberships = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/salgado/team_memberships HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> len(salgado_memberships)
  2

  >>> salgado_landscape = salgado_memberships[1]
  >>> sorted(salgado_landscape.keys())
  [u'date_expires', u'date_joined', u'member_link',
   u'reviewer_comment', u'reviewer_link', u'self_link', u'status',
   u'team_link']

  >>> salgado_landscape['self_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado/team_memberships/landscape-developers'
  >>> salgado_landscape['reviewer_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/name16'
  >>> salgado_landscape['member_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado'

A TeamMembership object is served as two resources: one in
relationship to the member, another in relationship to the team.

  >>> landscape_memberships = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers/member_memberships HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()

  >>> len(landscape_memberships)
  2

  >>> landscape_salgado = landscape_memberships[1]
  >>> landscape_salgado['self_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/landscape-developers/member_memberships/salgado'

Apart from the self_link, the two resources are identical.

  >>> del(landscape_salgado['self_link'])
  >>> del(salgado_landscape['self_link'])
  >>> sorted(landscape_salgado.items()) == sorted(salgado_landscape.items())
  True

A list of team memberships is distinct from a list of a team's
members. Members are people; memberships are, well, memberships.

  >>> landscape_memberships = webservice(r"""
  ... GET /people/landscape-developers/members HTTP/1.1
  ... Host: api.launchpad.dev
  ... """).jsonBody()
  >>> landscape_memberships[1]['self_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/people/salgado'
