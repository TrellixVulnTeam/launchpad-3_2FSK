  <p>This will add a new FAQ document to this project and it will be used
    to answer the question.
  </p>
  <p>The FAQ <b>Title</b> should make it easy to understand what this document
    is about. Using a question as title is often a good idea.
  </p>
  <p>You can enter additional <b>keywords</b> that apply to this document. It
    is not necessary to use words already appearing in the title.
  </p>
  <p>In the <b>content</b> field, enter a complete explanation on how to solve
    the question or problem. If the answer already exists on an external page
    (like a wiki), you can enter a short description of the document's content
    and provide a link to it.
  </p>
  <p>The <b>Answer Message</b> contains the message that will be added as an
    answer to the question. The FAQ's title will be automatically appended to
    this message.
