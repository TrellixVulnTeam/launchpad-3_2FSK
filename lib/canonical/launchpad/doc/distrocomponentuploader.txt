DistroComponentUploader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A DistroComponentUploader record is a granting of an upload right. It
couples a person (or team) to a component in a distribution.

The only clever thing about the DistroComponentUploader class is that
it implements the __contains__ method so that it can tell you if a
person is in the team which this DistroComponentUploader points at.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     DistroComponentUploader, Distribution, Component, Person)

First up, we find our DCU against ubuntu/main using the Ubuntu Team
from the sample data.

  >>> dcu = DistroComponentUploader.get(1)
  >>> mark = Person.get(1)
  >>> robert = Person.get(2)

We know Mark is in the team...

  >>> mark in dcu
  True

We also know that Robert isn't

  >>> robert in dcu
  False

Since a DCU record might simply be a single person, we set it to robert

  >>> old_uploader = dcu.uploader
  >>> dcu.uploader = robert

Now robert is in and mark isn't...

  >>> mark in dcu
  False
  >>> robert in dcu
  True

And we re-set it to the team to be clean

  >>> dcu.uploader = old_uploader
