= Anonymous Nomination of Bugs for Release =

Anonymous users should not be able to nominate bugs for release because
launchpad.Edit permission is required to do so.:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/jokosher/+bug/12')

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Nominate for release')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LinkNotFoundError
