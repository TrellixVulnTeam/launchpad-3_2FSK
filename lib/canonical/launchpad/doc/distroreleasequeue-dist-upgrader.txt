== DIST-UPGRADE upload ==

This test will check the upload of dist-upgrade tarballs

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IDistributionSet, IDistroReleaseSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUpload
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.uploadpolicy import findPolicyByName
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.tests import datadir

  >>> distro_release_set = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)
  >>> ubuntutest = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntutest']
  >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntutest['breezy-autotest']

  >>> import logging

  >>> class MockOptions:
  ...     distro = "ubuntutest"

  >>> from canonical.librarian.ftests.harness import LibrarianTestSetup
  >>> LibrarianTestSetup().setUp()

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IGPGKeySet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import GPGKeyAlgorithm
  >>> discarded_key = getUtility(IGPGKeySet).new(16, '6C64A8C5',
  ...     '340CA3BB270E2716C9EE0B768E7EB7086C64A8C5', 1024, GPGKeyAlgorithm.D)


  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

Login as an admin.

  >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

First, test the rejection of a missapplied changesfile name:

  >>> upload = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('sync'),
  ...     datadir(''), "dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes",
  ...     logging.getLogger())
  >>> mock_options = MockOptions()
  >>> upload.policy.setOptions(mock_options)

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import UploadError
  >>> try:
  ...    upload.process()
  ... except UploadError, info:
  ...    print 'BOOM:', info
  BOOM: dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes -> missapplied changesfile name, should follow "<pkg>_<version>_<arch>.changes" format


Now do a proper upload into the system.

  >>> class MockLogger:
  ...     def debug(self, s):
  ...         print "DEBUG:", s

  >>> upload = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('insecure'),
  ...     datadir(''), "dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes",
  ...     MockLogger())


  >>> upload.changes_filename == datadir(
  ...     "dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes")
  True

  >>> mock_options = MockOptions()
  >>> upload.policy.setOptions(mock_options)
  >>> upload.process()
  DEBUG: Beginning processing.
  DEBUG: Checking signature on changes file.
  DEBUG: Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes
  DEBUG: Verifying the changes file.
  DEBUG: Verifying files in upload.
  DEBUG: Performing overall file verification checks.
  DEBUG: Single Custom Upload detected.
  DEBUG: Finding and applying overrides.
  DEBUG: Foo Bar (16) is in main's uploaders.
  DEBUG: Finished checking upload.

It was not rejected.

  >>> upload.rejected
  False

  >>> success, msgs = upload.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Building recipients list.
  DEBUG: Creating a New queue entry
  DEBUG: Setting it to ACCEPTED

And all things worked.

  >>> success
  True

  >>> print upload.rejection_message

We need to commit the transaction to be able to use the librarian files.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Inspect the QUEUE looking for an ACCEPTED entry corresponding to the
previous upload:

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistroReleaseQueueStatus
  >>> queue_item = breezy_autotest.getQueueItems(
  ...      status=DistroReleaseQueueStatus.ACCEPTED)[0]
  >>> queue_item.customfiles[0].libraryfilealias.filename
  u'dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz'

Do the publish, i.e process the CustomUpload writing the tarball in
the archive

  >>> queue_item.realiseUpload()

Check what was published in the target directory:

  >>> import os
  >>> archive_dir = '/var/tmp/archive/'
  >>> upgrade_dir = 'ubuntutest/dists/breezy-autotest/main/dist-upgrader-all'
  >>> target_dir = os.path.join(archive_dir, upgrade_dir)
  >>> content = os.listdir(target_dir)
  >>> content
  ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Check the content of the directories published and the integrity of
the 'current' symbolic link (contents are the same)

  >>> real_path = os.path.join(target_dir, content[0])
  >>> link_path = os.path.join(target_dir, content[1])

  >>> assert os.path.islink(link_path) is True

  >>> os.listdir(real_path)
  ['ReleaseAnouncement', 'dapper.tar.gz']

  >>> os.listdir(link_path)
  ['ReleaseAnouncement', 'dapper.tar.gz']

Remove the directory to keep the test working.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(target_dir)

Switch Librarian off

  >>> LibrarianTestSetup().tearDown()
