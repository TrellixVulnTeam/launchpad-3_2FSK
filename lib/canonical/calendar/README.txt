Prototype for adding calendars to launchpad
===========================================

This code is probably in the wrong place, it doesn't have the proper copyright
notices, etc.

TODO: this package is going away:

    adapters will go to canonical.launchpad.component
    view/traverser hybrids will disappear completely
    unit tests will go whereever the units they test go


Hooking up the views
--------------------

This is now described in canonical/launchpad/doc/calendars.txt.
