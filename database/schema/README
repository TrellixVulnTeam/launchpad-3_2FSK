Update
======

We are now using launchpad-2-00-0.sql as our baseline, which is a
schema dump of the production server. The old files have all been
moved to the archive directory

Notes
=====
launchpad.sql has been moved from launchpad/database/launchpad.sql
to launchpad/database/schema/launchpad-1-0-0.sql. This file should
never be altered (if someone can tell me how to make arch throw a hissy
fit is someone tries, please let me know).

Alterations to the launchpad database schema need to be done as
patches - you can see the first one in
launchpad/database/schema/patch-1-1-0.sql.

I think a good process for changes to the schema is to email requested
changes to this mailing list (launchpad@rince.africaninspace.com)
and the acting DBA will approve the changes and put them in the
correct place. This is me this week, and Robert Collins for a few
weeks following that. I think the public forum is good for this so
everyone knows who is pissing in the pool and why. After a change,
I don't think I can fix any breakage caused in any areas I'm not
directly responsible or semi-responsible for, as this might cause
conflicts with work-in-progress I'm not aware of. Does this all
sound sane?

There is a Makefile in launchpad/database/schema that will
create the launchpad_test database (if it doesn't already exist),
drop all your tables and create the current schema with all patches
applied. The process to do this will become cleverer in the future
and not cause your sample data to be reset. A number of the targets
in the old Makefile (launchpad/database/Makefile) are now broken.

If you want to check anything into the launchpad/database/schema
directory, please do not give it a .sql extension or you will confuse
the simple Makefile.
