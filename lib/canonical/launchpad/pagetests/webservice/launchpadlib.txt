Using launchpadlib in pagetests
===============================

As an alternative to crafting HTTP requests with the 'webservice'
object, you can write pagetests using launchpadlib.

Two helper functions make it easy to set up Launchpad objects that
can access the web service. With launchpadlib_for() you can set up a
Launchpad object for a given user with a single call.

    >>> launchpad = launchpadlib_for(
    ...     'launchpadlib test', 'salgado', 'WRITE_PUBLIC')
    >>> print launchpad.me.name
    salgado

    # XXX leonardr 2010-03-31 bug=552732
    # launchpadlib doesn't work with a credential scoped to a context
    # like 'firefox', because the service root resource is considered
    # out of scope. This test should pass, but it doesn't.
    #
    # When you fix this, be sure to show that an attempt to access
    # something that really is out of scope (like launchpad.me.name)
    # yields a 401 error.
    #
    #>>> launchpad = launchpadlib_for(
    #...     'launchpadlib test', 'no-priv', 'READ_PRIVATE', 'firefox',
    #...      version="devel")
    #>>> print launchpad.projects['firefox'].name
    #firefox

With launchpadlib_credentials_for() you can get a launchpadlib
Credentials object.

    >>> from lp.testing import launchpadlib_credentials_for
    >>> credentials = launchpadlib_credentials_for(
    ...     'launchpadlib test', 'no-priv', 'READ_PUBLIC')
    >>> credentials
    <launchpadlib.credentials.Credentials object ...>

    >>> print credentials.consumer.key
    launchpadlib test
    >>> print credentials.access_token
    oauth_token_secret=...&oauth_token=...

This can be used to create your own Launchpad object.

    >>> from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials, 'http://api.launchpad.dev/')
    >>> print launchpad.me.name
    no-priv
