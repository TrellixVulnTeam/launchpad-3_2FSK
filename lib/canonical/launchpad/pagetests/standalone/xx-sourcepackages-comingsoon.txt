The "coming soon" page is a view on the ISourcePackageSet (which really
should be a Subset, and really should disappear entirely...) which
is rendered when there is a request for a '+gethelp' or '+translate'
page of a sourcepackage, where that particular sourcepackage doesn't exist
in that distrorelease.

The reason for this is that some packages have changed names between
hoary and breezy, and there are some new packages.  Gina has't been run
on production, so the full plethora of breezy packages aren't in there.

The distro team are concerned that people will click on "gethelp" on
the preview release, of breezy, and get an unpleasant 404 page rather
than some kind of more welcoming page.

The pagetest for these pages is using hoary because breezy doesn't have
any sourcepackages in the sample data.

First, get the translation page for a package that does exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/pmount/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...pmount in ubuntu hoary...
  ...
  ...<h1>Translate This Package</h1>...
  ...

Get the gethelp page for a package that exists.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/pmount/+gethelp HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...pmount in ubuntu hoary...
  ...
  ...<h1>Get Help Online!</h1>...
  ...

Get the translation page for a package that does not exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+translate HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The Hoary Hedgehog Release Source Packages...
  ...
  ...Coming soon...
  ...

Get the gethelp page for a package that does not exist.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+gethelp HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The Hoary Hedgehog Release Source Packages...
  ...
  ...Coming soon...
  ...

Get some other page for package that does not exist.  This shows that 404
errors still work, and that the 'coming soon' page is used only for
+gethelp and +translate pages.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+sources/doesnotexist/+nosuchpagehere HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  ...
