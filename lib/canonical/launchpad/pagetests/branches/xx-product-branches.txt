= Product Branches Overview =

Branch listing pages now hide dormant branches by default.  Dormant
branches are branches that have not been updated or committed to for
some time.

    >>> # To avoid a timebomb for last_modified, reset all branches here.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.branch_helper import (
    ...     reset_all_branch_last_modified)
    >>> reset_all_branch_last_modified()


Products link their branch listing page.

   >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/gnome-terminal')
   >>> browser.getLink('Code').click()
   >>> print browser.title
   GNOME Terminal's Bazaar branches registered in Launchpad

We are be able to display a list of branches for a product at +branches.

   >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/gnome-terminal/+branches')
   >>> print browser.title
   GNOME Terminal's Bazaar branches registered in Launchpad


== Default page for code site ==

When going directly to a product on the code rootsite for launchpad,
the +branches is the default page shown.

   >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/applets')
   >>> print browser.title
   Gnome Applets's Bazaar branches registered in Launchpad
   >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents).h1)
   Bazaar branches for Gnome Applets

If there are not any branches, a relevant message is shown.

   >>> message = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message')
   >>> print extract_text(message)
   There are no branches registered for Gnome Applets in Launchpad today.
   We recommend you visit www.bazaar-vcs.org
   for more information about how you can use
   the Bazaar revision control system to improve community
   participation in this project.

If there are branches, but they do not fit with the appropriate filter
we are given a different message.

   >>> browser.open(
   ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/firefox?field.lifecycle=Mature')
   >>> message = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message')
   >>> print extract_text(message)
   There are branches registered for Mozilla Firefox but none of them match
   the current filter criteria for this page. Try filtering on "Any Status".
