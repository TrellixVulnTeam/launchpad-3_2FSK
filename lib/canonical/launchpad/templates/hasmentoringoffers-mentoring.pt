    Launchpad lets you keep track of offers of mentorship from members of
    your community. Anybody who is a member of a team can offer to mentor
    work on a bug or a blueprint. Launchpad then keeps track of those
    offers, and you can use its listings as a convenient starting place for
    new contributors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Read the
    <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/MentoringManagement/">mentoring
    management documentation</a> for more detailed information.

    This list describes bugs and blueprints in

    and would like to know how to help, then this is a good place to start.
    Each of these items is likely to be a bite-sized piece of work which
    would be well-received by the community, and for which you know you will
    get good assistance and review.

    You can <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/MentoringManagement">learn
    more about this capability in Launchpad</a>, which allows you to
    create an "onramp" of
    bite-sized chunks of work for new people who want to contribute or to
    prove their worth.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, you can encourage members of your teams to offer mentoring
    on bugs and blueprints that they know how to fix or implement, but which
    they don't have time to get to personally. This list then makes a good
    starting point for new community members who want to make a contribution
    but don't know where to start.
