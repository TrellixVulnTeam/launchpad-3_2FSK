Ticket Comments
===============

We will examine Ticket #3, on Ubuntu. When not logged in, we should not be
able to make a comment.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...To post a comment you must...

When logged in, we should see the ability to add a comment. The default
subject should be based on the title, since there are no existing comments.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Add comment...
  ...<input name="field.subject" type="text" size="50"...value="Re: Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM" />...

If we POST that form, we should be redirected back to the ticket page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/+ticket/3/+addmessage HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=

  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other

And we should see the comment.

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Use a new computer...
  ...You silly fart...

Now we will examine Ticket #2 on Firefox. It should currently be Open,
and w should have the ability to make a comment.

comment, we don't have to mark the ticket as answered.
