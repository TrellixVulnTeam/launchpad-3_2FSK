database-frozen.txt
-------------------

If a file called 'database-frozen.txt' exists in the root of the
Launchpad tree, then merges containing database changes will be rejected
by PQM. Check the top level Makefile for the current rules on what this
means.

Status
------
launchpad/beta does not allow database updates as it needs to be kept in
sync with the production database.
