= Things a person is working on =

Any person page contains the bugs/blueprints a person is working on.

Sample Person is not working on any bugs/blueprints right now, so the section
won't be displayed.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/')  
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'working-on')
    None

We'll then change the statuses of some bugs that are already assigned to
Sample Person.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import BugTaskStatus
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     BugTaskSearchParams, IBugTaskSet, ILaunchBag, IPersonSet)
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name12')
    >>> params = BugTaskSearchParams(user=None, assignee=sample_person)
    >>> for task in getUtility(IBugTaskSet).search(params):
    ...     task.transitionToStatus(
    ...         BugTaskStatus.INPROGRESS, getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)

And the same for some blueprints.

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import SpecificationImplementationStatus
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Specification
    >>> spec = Specification.selectOneBy(name='media-integrity-check')
    >>> spec.assignee = sample_person
    >>> spec.delivery = SpecificationImplementationStatus.STARTED
    >>> newstate = spec.updateLifecycleStatus(sample_person)
    >>> logout()
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Let's see what we got on his page now.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/')
    >>> div = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'working-on')
    >>> for tag in div.findAll('tr'):
    ...     print tag.find('a').renderContents()
    Firefox install instructions should be complete
    Blackhole Trash folder
    CD Media Integrity Check

We even have a link for us to see all bugs that Sample Person is working on.

    >>> browser.getLink('Show all bugs in progress').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/...In+Progress'

Which obviously contains only the above two bugs we changed statuses.

    >>> table = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'buglisting')
    >>> for link in table.findAll('a'):
    ...     print link.renderContents()
    Firefox install instructions should be complete
    Blackhole Trash folder

For the specs, though, we don't have a page where it's possible to list only
the specs that have started but were not yet concluded, so for now we'll have
to link to the page which shows the whole list of specs assigned to the
person.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/')
    >>> browser.getLink('Show all assigned blueprints').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/.../+specs?role=assignee'

If one of the bugs that Sample Person is working on gets marked as a dupe of
another one, it'll be removed from the list of bugs he's working on.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bugset = getUtility(IBugSet)
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> bugset.get(5).duplicateof = bugset.get(4)
    >>> logout()
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/')
    >>> div = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'working-on')
    >>> for tag in div.findAll('tr'):
    ...     print tag.find('a').renderContents()
    Blackhole Trash folder
    CD Media Integrity Check
