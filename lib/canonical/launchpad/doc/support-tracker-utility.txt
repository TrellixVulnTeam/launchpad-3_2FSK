== Support Tracker Utility: ITicketSet ==

There is an ITicketSet utility that can be use to retrieve and search
for ticket whatever the target they were created in.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITicketSet
    >>> ticket_set = getUtility(ITicketSet)
    >>> verifyObject(ITicketSet, ticket_set)
    True

== get() ==

The get() method can be used to get a ticket with a specific id:

    >>> ticket_one = ticket_set.get(1)
    >>> ticket_one.title
    u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site'

If no ticket exists, a default value is returned:

    >>> default = object()
    >>> ticket_nonexistant = ticket_set.get(123456, default=default)
    >>> ticket_nonexistant is default
    True

If no default value is given, None is returned:

    >>> ticket_set.get(123456) is None
    True
