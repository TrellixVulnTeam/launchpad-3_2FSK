Sourcerer
---------

	"There was a man and he had eight sons.  Apart from that, he
	 was nothing more than a comma on the page on History.  It's
	 sad, but that's all you can say about some people.
	   But the eighth son grew up and married and had eight sons,
	 and because there is only one suitable profession for the
	 eighth son of an eighth son, he became a wizard.  And he
	 became wise and powerful, or at any rate powerful, and wore a
	 pointed hat and there it would have ended ...
	   Should have ended ...
	   But against the Lore of Magic and certainly against all
	 reason -- except the reasons of the heart, which are warm and
	 messy and, well, /unreasonable/ -- he fled the halls of magic
	 and fell in love and got married, not necessarily in that
	 order.
	   And he had seven sons, each one from the cradle at least as
	 powerful as any wizard in the world.
	   And then he had an eighth son.
	   A wizard squared.  A source of magic.
	   A sourcerer."

	   -- Terry Pratchett, Sourcery.


This is the Debian-specific version of Sourcerer, it is only intended for use
with Debian source packages.  The basic idea is to test out the general
principles with some code we have an immediate use for and then merge in
support for other package formats at a later stage.
