    <h1>About Rosetta</h1>

    <p>
    Rosetta is a web tool for translating any open source software into any
    language. The ultimate goal of the Rosetta Project is to ensure that every
    piece of open source software is usable in every language. We invite you to
    find the open source software you use the most, and help to translate it into
    your own home language, if it is not already completely translated. All you
    need is a web browser, a good knowledge of the application you are translating,
    and a good knowledge of English and your own language.
    </p>

    <p>
    To participate in the development and testing of Rosetta please join the <a
    href="http://lists.ubuntulinux.org/mailman/listinfo/rosetta-users">Rosetta
    users mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Currently we have only a few applications listed in Rosetta. If you'd like
    a piece of software added to Rosetta, please submit a <a
    href="projects/+request">request for a project to be included</a>.
