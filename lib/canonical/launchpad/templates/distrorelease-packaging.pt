      This page shows the links from packages in the distribution to
      upstream branches. Those links enable us to share bugs and
      translations and patches very efficiently between the distribution and
      upstream.

  <h1>Linking to Upstream</h1>

  <p>HCT uses "packaging" information to link a source package in a
  distribution to upstream product series.</p>

  <p class="portalMessage" tal:condition="not: context/packagings">
    There are no links between packages in <span
    tal:replace="context/displayname">Hoary</span> and upstream! Please add
    packaging information for specific packages in this release that are
    different to previous Ubuntu releases, to ensure we can collaborate
    effectively with upstream.
  </p>

  <h2>Unlinked Translatable Packages</h2>

  <table class="listing">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Source Package</th>
        <th>Version</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr tal:repeat="sp view/unlinked_translatables">

  <p>Note: the distribution will also inherit packaging data from
  previous releases, as well as its parent Ubuntu distribution, so you may
  also want to look for packaging information in those releases too. This
  page should list only the packaging details for packages which have been
  specifically modified inside this release.</p>
