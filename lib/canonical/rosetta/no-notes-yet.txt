Guidelines

- All pages to be discoverable from the front page, or other discoverable
  pages.

- No broken pages (404s).  Use the no-page-yet template instead.

- For links that don't have a page in the URL table, use the no-url-yet page.

- For links that depend on app components we don't have, use
  the no-app-component-yet page.

Process

1. Convert no-page-yet pages into real pages.
   Ensure that all links described on the wiki specification of the new
   page link to something, even if it is a no-page-yet, no-url-yet or
   no-app-component-yet page.

2. Add URLs to the wiki URLs table for no-url-yet links.
   When you've done this, change the no-url-yet into a no-page-yet.

3. When an app component is implemented, some of the no-app-component-yet
   pages can be replaced with no-page-yet pages.
