  Reactivate the subscription for 'name16', on team 'myemail', which we just
  deactivated.


  Go to the member's page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/myemail/+members/name16 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vQGJhei5jb206Zg==
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
  ...Foo Bar...
  ...
  ...Deactivated Member...
  ...


  Click on the 'Reactivate' button.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /people/myemail/+members/name16 HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vQGJhei5jb206Zg==

  Got redirected to the team's members page, and see the reactivated member
  listed as an active member.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/myemail/+members/ HTTP/1.1

  Let's make sure that 'name16' is now an APPROVED member of this team.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamMembership
  >>> foobar = Person.byName('name16')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> tm = TeamMembership.selectOneBy(personID=foobar.id, teamID=team.id)
  >>> tm.statusname
  'Approved Member'
  >>> foobar.inTeam(team)
  True
