      <p>Hello. We plan to clarify the licence applied to translations
        made in Launchpad. Soon, all translations in Launchpad will use
        the BSD licence.</p>

      <p>We would like your permission to apply the BSD licence to the
        translations you've already made in Launchpad and also to any
        future translations you make in Launchpad.</p>

      <p>We've chosen the BSD licence because it is universally
        compatible with projects that use other licences. That's ideal
        because Launchpad shares your translations work with other
        people and projects.</p>

      <p>To see which translations are affected, visit your
        <a tal:attributes="href string:${context/fmt:url}">translations</a>
        page.</p>

      <p>Please tell us if you're happy to use the BSD licence, using
        the link below. If you change your mind, you can return here
        by following the
        "<a tal:attributes="href view/relicensing_url">Translations
        licensing"</a> link on your translations page at any time
        until July 31st.</p>

      <p>If you choose not to use the BSD licence, we will remove your
        translations from Launchpad shortly after July 31st.</p>

      <p>For more about why we're clarifying translations licensing,
        take a look at our
        <a href="http://help.launchpad.net/Translations/LicensingFAQ">
        translations licensing FAQ</a>.</p>
