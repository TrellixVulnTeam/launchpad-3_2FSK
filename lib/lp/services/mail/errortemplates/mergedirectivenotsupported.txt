Launchpad no longer accepts merge directives, because this functionality was not being used.  We apologise for the inconvenience.  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/989831 for details.

To create merge proposals from the commandline, consider using "bzr lp-propose-merge".  This command is from the launchpad plugin which usually ships with Bazaar.  Of course, you can also use the Launchpad web site to create merge proposals.
