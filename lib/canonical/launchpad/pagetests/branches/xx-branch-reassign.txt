= Reassigning a branch =

The owner of a branch can be changed in the $branch/+reassign form.

Impressed by his notorious fluency in foreign languages, we want to transfer
the GNOME Terminal Klingon support branch to SABDFL.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people/name12/+branch/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Change Registrant').click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/people/name12/+branch/gnome-terminal/klingon/+reassign'
    >>> user_browser.getControl(name='field.owner').value = 'sabdfl'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Change Owner').click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/people/sabdfl/+branch/gnome-terminal/klingon'

However, arguing that common Klingon habits are incompatible with the Ubuntu
Code of Conduct, and that Klingon rocket technology is no match to the Russian,
SABDFL declines and asks an administrator to reassign the branch back.

Incidentally that restores the test data to its initial state.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/people/sabdfl/+branch/gnome-terminal/klingon/+reassign')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name='field.owner').value = 'name12'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Owner').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/people/name12/+branch/gnome-terminal/klingon'


NOTE: transferring to a team we are creating is not tested here. This is a
stock function of ObjectReassignmentView, we expect it is covered in other
tests. -- David Allouche 2006-08-15


FIXME: Test that changing the branch owner to a user that already has a branch
with this name and product gives a useful error message and does not OOPS.
