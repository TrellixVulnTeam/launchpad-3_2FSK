= Converting people into teams =

There's a script which allows us to turn any person whose account_status
is NOACCOUNT into a team.  The script takes the name of the person to be
converted into a team and the name of the team owner as arguments.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> spiv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('spiv')
    >>> spiv.isTeam()
    False
    >>> spiv.account_status
    <DBItem AccountStatus.NOACCOUNT...

    >>> from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
    >>> process = Popen(
    ...     'scripts/convert-person-to-team.py -q spiv sabdfl',
    ...     shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> out, err
    ('', '')
    >>> process.returncode
    0

    # XXX: The script already committed its transaction but for some reason
    # we need to do another commit here. -- Guilherme Salgado, 2007-10-25
    >>> import transaction; transaction.commit()

    # Flush the caches because our objects were changed in another
    # transaction.
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_caches
    >>> flush_database_caches()

    >>> spiv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('spiv')
    >>> spiv.isTeam()
    True
