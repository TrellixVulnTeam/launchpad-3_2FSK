ProjectGroup views
==================

The +index view of projectgroup has a has_many_projects property. It is
used by the template to determine how to layout out the page. A project
with less than 10 projects is considered not have many projects.

    >>> projectgroup = factory.makeProject(name='mothership')
    >>> view = create_view(projectgroup, name='+index')
    >>> projectgroup.products.count()
    0

    >>> view.has_many_projects
    False

    >>> def add_daughter(projectgroup, letters):
    ...     for letter in letters:
    ...         name = '%s-%s' % (letter, projectgroup.name)
    ...         product = factory.makeProduct(
    ...             name=name, owner=projectgroup.owner)
    ...         product.project = projectgroup

    >>> login_person(projectgroup.owner)
    >>> add_daughter(projectgroup, 'a')
    >>> projectgroup.products.count()
    1

    >>> view = create_view(projectgroup, name='+index')
    >>> view.has_many_projects
    False

A projectgroup with more than 10 sub projects is considered to have many
projects (10 projects are roughly 2 portlets deep.)

    >>> add_daughter(projectgroup, 'bcdefghijk')
    >>> projectgroup.products.count()
    11

    >>> view = create_view(projectgroup, name='+index')
    >>> view.has_many_projects
    True
