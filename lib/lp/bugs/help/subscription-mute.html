    <h1>What happens when I "mute" a bug?</h1>

    <p>
      You may have a subscription to a bug target (e.g. a project or
      distribution) that sends email notifications about bug activity.
      However, you may not be interested in a particular bug.  In that case
      you can "mute" the bug and you will not receive notifications about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When "unmuting" a bug you are asked what kinds of messages you would
      like to receive about the bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are subscribed via a team, but the team delivers its bug messages
      via a mailing list or some other preferred email, the mute will not be
      honored because doing so would prevent the other team members from
      receiving the notifications.
