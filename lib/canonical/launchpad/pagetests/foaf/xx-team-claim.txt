= Claiming an automatically created team =

Sometimes (mostly when processing package uploads) Launchpad will create new
people when in fact it should have created teams.  When that happens, it
should be possible for a user to claim these profiles and turn them into a
teams.

On the home page of any automatically created person, there's a link which
allow the logged in user to claim that profile, but if we have any
indication the profile may actually represent a team, we instead provide a
link to turn it into a team.

For instance, we have an auto-created profile for Alexander Limi, which
definitely doesn't seem to be a team.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~limi')
    >>> browser.getLink(url='+claim')
    <Link text="Hey, I'm Alexander Limi"...

If we mutate that profile a bit, though, to make it look more like a team,
the link will change.  Currently we're only checking for the occurence of
'@lists.' on any email address associated with the person in question as a
sign that this could be a team instead, so we'll just add a new email
address to Limi.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import EmailAddressSet, PersonSet
    >>> limi = PersonSet().getByName('limi')
    >>> email = EmailAddressSet().new('foo@lists.host.com', limi)

    >>> browser.reload()
    >>> browser.getLink(url='+claimteam')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> browser.getLink(url='+claim')
    <Link text="Hey, I'm Alexander Limi"...

As we see above, though, the link didn't change, but that's because only
logged in users can convert a person into a team.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~limi')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Hey, this is a team I run').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Claim team'

Now we enter any of limi's email address to continue the process of turning
him into a team.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Email address').value = 'foo@lists.host.com'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Alexander Limi does not use Launchpad'

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(user_browser):
    ...     print msg
    A confirmation message has been sent to 'foo@lists.host.com'. Follow the
    instructions in that message to finish claiming this team. (If the above
    address is from a mailing list, it may be necessary to talk with one of
    its admins to accept the message from Launchpad so that you can finish
    the process.)

    # Follow the link sent to us by email.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.logintoken import (
    ...     get_token_url_from_email)
    >>> from_addr, to_addr, msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> to_addr
    ['foo@lists.host.com']
    >>> token_url = get_token_url_from_email(msg)
    >>> token_url
    'http://launchpad.dev/token/...'

    >>> user_browser.open(token_url)
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Claim Launchpad team'

    # The owner of the claimed team will be the person who started the claim
    # process and that can't be changed here.
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Team Owner')
