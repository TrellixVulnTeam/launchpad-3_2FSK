= Language Pack storage =

LanguagePack class represents a distribution series' Language pack exported.

It help us to track all exports and to know which full export is associated
with a delta one.

A delta language pack is an export that has all translation resources that
were updated since the export date for the associate full export.

    >>> from cStringIO import StringIO
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, ILanguagePack, ILanguagePackSet,
    ...     LanguagePackType)
    >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient

Let's upload a dummy file to librarian.

    >>> uploader = getUtility(ILibrarianClient)
    >>> content = 'foo'
    >>> file_alias = uploader.addFile(
    ...     name='foo.tar.gz',
    ...     size=len(content),
    ...     file=StringIO(content),
    ...     contentType='application/x-gtar')

We need too a distribution series to link the language pack with it.

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu.getSeries('hoary')

We add the language pack.

    >>> language_pack_set = getUtility(ILanguagePackSet)
    >>> language_pack = language_pack_set.addLanguagePack(
    ...     hoary, file_alias, LanguagePackType.FULL)

And it implements and follow the ILanguagePack interface.

    >>> ILanguagePack.providedBy(language_pack)
    True
    >>> verifyObject(ILanguagePack, language_pack)
    True
