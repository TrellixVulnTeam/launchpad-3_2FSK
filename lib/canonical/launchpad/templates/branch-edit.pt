  <p>Launchpad is integrated with the <a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> version control system. (<a
    href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/WhyUseBzr">Why use Bazaar?</a>).</p>

  <p>You can edit the details of branches you are the registrant of, or whose
    registrant is a team you belong to.</p>

  <p>The URL of the branch on Launchpad is based on the nickname of the
    registrant, the name of the associated project, and the name of the branch.
    All these values can be changed.</p>

  <p>If the branch is a <em>mirror</em> branch, you can change remote URL that
    it is mirroring.</p>

  <p>A mirror branch cannot be converted to an upload branch, and conversely,
    you cannot convert an upload branch to a mirror branch. However you can
    rename a branch and create a new one in its place.<p>

  <p>The title and the summary appear in listing and on the branch page, they
    should describe the branch contents and purpose. The whiteboard appears on
    the branch page, and is a good place to write more detailed comments on the
    status of the branch.</p>

  <p>The author allows you to give credit for the branch to another Launchpad
    person. It should usually be set to the registrant of the branch. If it is
    blank, it means the author of the branch is not a person known to
    Launchpad.</p>

  <p>The web page is optional, and purely informative. It is left blank for
    most branches.</p>
